 Shaitaan Box Office Estimate Day 1: Ajay Devgn's horror flick casts a spell with a stellar start; collects Rs. 14.50 crores on Day 1 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 21:58:00 +0200 
 The Ajay Devgn-led Shaitaan has taken a very good start at the box office in India as early estimates suggest an opening day in the range of Rs. 14.25 to 15.25 crores. The horror thriller has surpassed all expectations and is proving to be a surprise package as far as the theatrical run is concerned. The top 3 national chains are headed to collect Rs. 7.25 crores, contributing around 50 percent to the total business.The film has done well universally - be it the metros or the mass belts - and the early audience reports are also supremely positive. The best business of Shaitaan has come from Mumbai followed by mass centres like CI, CP, and Rajasthan. Shaitaan will be looking at an opening weekend of Rs. 55 crores, and the audience reports from the cinema hall suggest the film will have a long run at the box office.Shaitaan was looking like a weak film however, the tides changed when the makers launched the theatrical trailer two weeks before the release. Mass Maharaja, Ajay Devgn is driving the business as it has been a while seen a leading film hero featured in a film of this genre.Shaitaan is not really an adult film and the treatment of the subject makes it palatable for the family audience too and this gives a shot for the film to have better legs in the long run. The start is very good, boosted by the Maha Shivratri holiday in mass belts, and its now all on the weekend growth 
 Shaitaan becomes Ajay Devgn’s biggest overseas release; to release in 1200+ screens in over 60 countries overseas 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 21:50:32 +0200 
 It seems like Shaitaan starring Ajay Devgn is generating quite a buzz, especially with its extensive overseas release. Directed by Vikas Bahl and featuring R Madhavan in a negative role, the film is anticipated to make a significant impact in the international market. With screenings planned in over 60 countries across 950+ locations and 1200 screens, it's poised to be Ajay Devgn's biggest overseas release to date.The wide release strategy, coupled with the excitement surrounding the film and its promotional efforts, is expected to drive impressive opening day collections. Early previews in the U.S.A and G.C.C territories have already received positive feedback, further fuelling anticipation for its international debut.Presented by Jio Studios, Devgn Films, and Panorama Studios, Shaitaan is described as a supernatural-thriller. Funasia Films and Marudhar Entertainment Network are handling distribution in the overseas market. Fans can catch the film when it releases on Friday, March 8. 
 Shaitaan Box Office Prediction: Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan starrer all set for a good start 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 13:35:31 +0200 
 The month of March is all set to embark on a good start, what with Shaitaan poised to take a positive start at the box office. Horror/supernatural genre was once considered to be a safe genre with a decent to good opening always guaranteed to come in. However, over the years, hardly any films are made in this space and hence with Shaitaan coming in, it’s a welcome relief.The fact that Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan are spearheading the show makes the film even bigger because typically there are mid-level stars or newcomers on such movies. However, their presence has lent added credibility to the film and made it accessible to a much larger audience base. All of that is for nothing though if the promo doesn’t work but in case of Shaitaan, this is a positive since audience awareness is there and that should ensure that the footfalls are at least decent enough to begin with.This one is primarily a word-of-mouth affair so even Rs. 7-8 crores opening would have been a nice enough start. However, advance booking has indicated some sort of momentum already building around the film which means a Rs. 10 crores start is pretty much there for the taking and there is possibility of Rs. 12 crores mark been reached as well. Given the mid-budget set up of the Vikas Bahl film, a start in Rs. 10-12 crores will ensure that the stage is set for it to further grow well over the weekend on the basis of strong word-of-mouth. 
 Shaitaan Advance Booking Update: Ajay Devgn's horror epic sells 35,000 tickets across the National multiplex chains; gears up for Rs. 10.5 cr. opening on Day 1 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 09:51:45 +0200 
 The Vikas Bahl directed Shaitaan starring Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan has fetched a good response in advance booking. As on early morning on Thursday, the horror film has sold approx. 35,000 tickets across the Top 3 national multiplex chains – PVR, Inox &amp; Cinepolis. The film is looking to rake in overall pre-sales of 70,000 tickets in the national multiplex chains.The advance booking of Shaitaan will end up being 2 times higher than Devgn's last release, Bholaa, which co-incidentally again released on Maha Shivratri. Shaitaan will be looking to open at Rs. 10.50 crores on Friday, which is a good start for a horror film made on a limited budget.If the film carries positive report, Shaitaan will be looking to grow over the weekend and pack a punch. The trailer of Shaitaan was solid and the impact of the theatrical trailer is visible in pre-sales. Interestingly, the advance bookings are good in non national chains and single screens too, and this has got a lot to do with the Ajay Devgn factor.Shaitaan is all set to release on March 9, 2024. Stay tuned for Bollywood Hungama's review of this horror thriller. 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer is the top performing film on Monday 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 17:19:44 +0200 
 Amongst all the films in the running, Article 370 has emerged as the top performing of them all. Despite new releases as well as some holdover films, it’s the geopolitical action drama that’s finding the most footfalls for 11 days in a row now. The film has pretty much come on its own and for the rest of the week too, it would be bringing in the most footfalls on a daily basis.This was seen not just over the weekend gone by when the collections were quite good but now at the start of the weekdays as well, what with Rs. 2 crores* been collected at the box office. For a film of this sort of scale, size, setting and genre, such collections are good enough to keep coming on the weekdays of Week 2. In fact, as long as collections stay over Rs. 1.50 crores mark right through the weekdays, it would be good enough as the film has already recovered its cost and has been making profits with its current total standing at Rs. 56.44 crores*.Meanwhile, one waits to see how much distance Laapataa Ladies covers in days to come. Theatrically, its business is not in line with the merits and one expected Monday to see some sort of hold. That was going to be always challenging, especially since the opening weekend hadn’t seen the kind of jumps that would have got it into a comfortable spot as had happened with 12th Fail. Hence, with Monday coming to Rs. 0.35 crores and the overall collections moving to Rs. 4.10 crores, all eyes would be on the best that it can gather in its lifetime run.*Estimates. Final numbers awaitedNote: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer crosses half century, is following better trajectory than Neerja 
 
 
 Mon, 04 Mar 2024 12:37:54 +0200 
 On its release back in 2016, Sonam Kapoor starrer Neerja had collected Rs. 4.70 crores on its opening day. It grew well over the weekend to register Rs. 22.01 crores, had a strong first week that closed at Rs. 35.32 crores, and then more than doubled that number in its lifetime by closing at Rs. 75.65 crores. Now, the Yami Gautam starrer Article 370, which is also a female led geopolitical action drama, is following a somewhat better trajectory. After collecting Rs. 6.12 crores on its first day, registering a weekend of Rs. 25.45 crores and then enjoying a first week score of Rs. 38.82 crores, it is very likely heading well towards a lifetime score of Rs. 75 crores.This has been assured by yet another super solid day that it scored on Sunday when Rs. 7.25 crores came in. While Neerja had a lesser second Sunday with a score of Rs. 6.65 crores, Article 370 has gone up and will now be staying over the Rs. 2 crores mark on a daily basis. Once that happens then a Rs. 75 crores lifetime will be very much possible. Currently, the film stands at Rs. 54.44 crores.Meanwhile, Laapataa Ladies had a weekend of Rs. 4.12 crores. The film had started with Rs. 1.02 crores and then saw some growth in collections on Saturday and then Sunday. Ideally, the numbers should have kept doubling on a day-by-day basis but while that hasn't happened, one now waits to see if today the numbers turn out to be greater than Friday. If that turns out to be the case, then there may be some sort of run that the Kiran Rao directed film may have.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer stays over Rs. 3 crores mark on weekdays 
 
 
 Fri, 01 Mar 2024 12:38:33 +0200 
 Strong hold over the weekdays has allowed Article 370 to enjoy a good Week One at the box office. The film stayed over Rs. 3 crores mark right through with collections holding quite well from Rs. 3.60 crores on Monday to Rs. 3.07 crores on Thursday. This is really impressive because stability like this promises a good second week as well.By the look of things, the film should earn in the vicinity of Rs. 3 crores today as well since there is just no competition at least as yet. Laapataa Ladies has released along with half a dozen other releases but that too would start coming on its own during the rest of the weekend only. Till then, it would be Article 370 that will keep bringing in audiences and there would be good push that it will see tomorrow and day after in particular.The film has done well enough to reach Rs. 38.82 crores so far, which is a good number. That said, it hasn’t quite gone ahead and hit the roof just like The Kashmir Files or The Kerala Story had done on their release. These two films had seen exponential hike in numbers during the opening weekend itself and then got into an altogether different trajectory during the weekdays. On the contrary, Article 370 hasn’t quite seen that kind of trend but behaved more like an appreciated film that sees a regular organic trending.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sees negligible drop on Tuesday 
 
 
 Wed, 28 Feb 2024 13:13:10 +0200 
 It was a negligible drop on Tuesday for Yami Gautam starrer Article 370 as Rs. 3.55 crores came in. On Monday the film had held well at Rs. 3.60 crores and now that it has stayed around the same number all over again, it’s very good trending. This is the kind of hold which would be expected today and tomorrow as well which will allow the film to have a healthy first week score.The film benefits from the fact that it’s a largely open week ahead. On Friday arrives Laapataa Ladies and while there are half a dozen other films that will arrive as well, they will primarily see a token release. As for Laapataa Ladies, it would be a word-of-mouth film which means its collections will start gaining momentum from Saturday onwards. In the midst of this all, since Article 370 is a set film, it will benefit the most and hence momentum would be there in its favour.So far, the film had collected Rs. 32.60 crores and it should score a half century by Sunday itself. From there it should eventually cross Rs. 65 crores lifetime at the very least though as has been seen in the past, sometimes set films keep playing on and on and this is what the team of Article 370 would be hoping for.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sails through on Monday, should see minimal drops during weekdays 
 
 
 Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:16:14 +0200 
 Article 370 has sailed through well on Monday with 3.60 crores coming in. Anything over Rs. 3.50 crores would have been a good total for this controlled budgeted film and here the collections are wee bit more than that, which puts it in a comfortable state. The drop from Friday collections of Rs. 6.12 crores is also under control since the day also saw added footfalls due to Cinema Lovers Day, which gave the film the kind of push that happens on a partial holiday, and hence that needs to be taken into consideration as well.The Yami Gautam and Priyamani starrer has now reached Rs. 29.05 crores and will comfortably cross Rs. 40 crores mark by close of first week. It’s good to see the way the actress has been making a mark with her theatrical releases as well since last year she had already delivered a Rs. 100 Crore Club success with OMG 2. While one waits to see if Article 370 manages to push its way past the century mark as well, rest assured it would be a good success for sure and enjoy a long run.It’s good to see different genre of films finding audiences this year. It all started with HanuMan followed by Fighter and now Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya followed by Article 370; goes on to show that audiences are receptive to different kind of films regardless of genre, the scale at which the they have been made and whether it’s a core theatrical or ‘OTT type of film’.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources

 Article 370 Box Office: Scores a very healthy weekend, all eyes on weekday holds now 
 
 
 Mon, 26 Feb 2024 12:27:03 +0200 
 The weekend has done the job for Article 370. After a very good start that happened on Friday and subsequently huge growth on Saturday, the film came on its own on Sunday as well. The collections were rock solid at Rs. 10.25 crores and that's pretty positive for this film, which has a new director Aditya Suhas Jambhale calling the shots. Even to conceive a film with a subject like this is challenging in itself and the fact that he has actually executed it well and that too in an entertaining manner says a lot about how cinema is evolving in Bollywood.Just when it had started seeming that only hardcore massy action masala movies are working at the box office, it's heartening to see a geopolitical drama like Article 370 hit the screens and find good audience for itself. While one waits to see where does it eventually head towards, the fact remains that it's a clear success in the making and at the very least, a lifetime of over Rs. 75 crores is on the cards with possibility of a Rs. 100 Crore Club entry as well.The Yami Gautam and Priyamani starrer has already netted Rs. 25.45 crores and by the look of things, weekdays would be rather stable too. That means the first week numbers will comfortably go past the Rs. 40 crores mark and post that there would be good collections coming in weeks to come as well, since this isn't just one of those routine first weekend/first week films. Last year, Yami Gautam had scored as a lawyer with grey shades in OMG 2 and now in this rather heroic part in Article 370, she has proven her mettle all over again.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources

 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sees huge growth on Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 25 Feb 2024 13:26:14 +0200 
 After taking a very good start on Friday when Rs. 6.12 crores came in, Article 370 came on its own on Saturday with consistent footfalls all over again. In fact, the film had played on reduced ticket rates on Friday but now on Saturday the prices have come to normal as well. This turned out to be a double whammy for the film as the collections zoomed further to Rs. 9.08 crores.Now even if the collections would have stayed at the same levels, it wouldn't have been bad since a large chunk of audience had anyways watched the film on Friday, and as a result the footfalls could have been lesser. However, none of that happened for the film since word of mouth is quite strong and as a result of that more and more people have been excited well enough to catch it in theatres. In fact, not just the class audience but even a good segment of masses is patronizing the film as well due to several fiery dialogues and clap-worthy scenes.The Yami Gautam starrer has now moved up to Rs. 15.20 crores and with further growth on the anvil today, the collections will rather comfortably go past the Rs. 25 crores milestone. That would be truly remarkable for the film since even if that would have been an entire Week One number, the controlled budgeted film would still have been rather comfortably placed.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office Estimate Day 2: Yami Gautam film jumps by 35%; collects Rs. 8 crores on Saturday 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 22:38:38 +0200 
 The Yami Gautam led Article 370 has shown a fantastic growth in collections on second day. According to early estimates, the Aditya Dhar produced political thriller is seeing a 35% jump in the business leading to box office collection of Rs. 7.75 to 8.25 crore. With this, the two-day total of Article 370 stands at Rs 14.00 crore.The Yami Gautam film has shown a spike in numbers despite overperforming on the opening day owing to the Cinema Lovers Day. This feat is a replica of film showing a spike in business after a national holiday. The two-day trend of Article 370 points to a likely stronghold in numbers on Monday.Article 370 might show another upward jump on Sunday and lock an opening weekend of Rs. 24 crore, which is a fantastic result for a film with a controlled budget and this star cast. With Fighter edging close to Rs. 200 crores in India, followed by Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya scoring Rs. 63 crores, and now Article 370, one can safely say that 2024 has started decently and its on Shaitaan, Yodha, Maidaan, and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan to continue the momentum. 
 Box Office: Good day for Bollywood as Article 370 and Crakk cross Rs. 10 crores mark on Friday, Cinema Lovers Day 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 14:53:28 +0200 
 It turned out to be a good Friday for Bollywood as over Rs. 10 crores came in. Article 370 and Crakk were the two new releases of the week and while the former took a very good opening, the latter did well as well. What further helped the collections was Cinema Lovers Day been (suddenly) declared a couple of days before releases, as a result of which the tickets were made available for a mere Rs. 99. This helped in increased footfalls, though that worked more for Crakk since it’s a massy film and hence lower ticket prices helped.As for the collections, Article 370 brought in Rs. 6.12 crores on its first day and that's a really good number considering the fact that this one is a geopolitical drama with a lot of constitutional jargon. That could well alienate a large chunk of audience but then on the flipside there is a lot for the class audience which means at the premium multiplexes with higher priced tickets, the film will come on its own from today. Since critical acclaim is high on the film and word of mouth amongst audiences really solid, expect the collections to increase over the weekend.On the other hand, Crakk is an out and out massy film and hence it made sense to entice maximum count of audiences on the first day itself, so that the word of mouth spreads fast. The film does appeal to the gentry, though its polished treatment and truly big screen appeal offers to the young generation as well, especially those who are into gaming and extreme sports. A start of Rs. 4.11 crores has been taken, which is the third best for Vidyut Jammwal after Commando 3 and Commando 2, and now it's about the kind of momentum that it picks from this point on.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer earns an impressive Rs. 6.12 crores 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 12:54:21 +0200 
 Kashmir has been one of the favourite subjects of Bollywood films, especially the ones which deal with politics. Filmmaker Aditya Dhar’s production Article 370 is also a political drama based in the valley with a dose of action. Starring Yami Gautam Dhar in the lead, the movie looks back at the abrogation of Article 370 from the state in 2019.The film, which released yesterday on February 23, was expected to perform decently at the box office. But it has actually surpassed expectations by taking a positive opening of Rs. 6.12 crores in India. By doing this, the movie has proved all calculations and estimations wrong.One needs to note that Article 370, like many other films playing in theatres, was benefitted by the fact that it was Cinema Lovers Day yesterday, through which one could watch any movie in any theatre and at any time just for Rs. 99. So, it will be interesting to see if the film continues to earn well today (Saturday) and on Sunday. The reviews from the critics and the audience’s word-of-mouth has been positive. Hence, the movie has a good chance of continuing its momentum.Directed by Aditya Jambhale, Article 370 also stars Priyamani, Arun Govil, Kiran Karmarkar, among others.Also Read: Yami Gautam Dhar REACTS after PM Narendra Modi mentions Article 370 in his speech; actress says, “Hope that we all exceed your expectations” 
 Article 370 Box Office Estimate Day 1: Yami Gautam's film opens well; collects Rs. 5.75 crores on Friday 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 21:34:49 +0200 
 The much-spoken-about Article 370 starring Yami Gautam has taken a good start at the box office in India. As per early estimates, the Aditya Dhar production has collected in the range of Rs. 5.26 to 6.25 crores on the opening day, surpassing all the pre-release predictions.The political thriller has benefitted on account of cinema lovers day where the ticket was priced at flat Rs. 99 and the move has also resulted in a bigger sampling for the film among the audience. The initial reports are very positive and there is a bright chance for Article 370 to do what Kashmir Files and Kerala Story did in 2022 and 2023 respectively, though one needs to wait for the Saturday trend to say this with surety.The pricing goes back to Normal on Saturday and the trend from hereon will be interesting to see as Article 370 has over-indexed on Friday. If the film manages to be stable at the same levels on Saturday, it's poised for a long run at the box office and if by chance there is a jump in the biz, sky will be the limit.Article 370 is made on a controlled budget and with this start, it is sure to be a major money spinner for all the stakeholders.

 Box Office: Article 370, Crakk, Teri Baaton Mein Kaisa Uljha Jiya expected to bring in over Rs. 15 crores today, Cinema Lover’s Day 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:32:46 +0200 
 After National Cinema Day, looks like another big box office event would be designated for Cinema Lover’s Day. One hopes that something like this happens every year because if the response so far to the expected box office performances of today’s releases is any indication then audiences are truly embracing the big day.Article 370 and Crakk are the two new releases of today and they are set for a good to excellent start. With the ticket prices set at Rs. 99, online sales have been huge already with advance booking hitting the roof. To have more than 1 lakh tickets been sold for Article 370 and 50,000 crossing for Crakk further reflects that audiences are looking forward to some good entertainment at the big screen. Moreover, there has been genuine interest in the two films too amongst the target audience, because if that’s not the case then even Rs. 50 tickets don’t sell.As of now, the Yami Gautam starrer is comfortably placed for a Rs. 7-8 crores start and it won’t be surprising if it goes further high and even hit a double digit score. That would be a stretch given the ticket prices but then anything is possible when word of mouth catches up. On the other hand Vidyut Jammwal and Arjun Rampal starrer Crakk too is seeing a potential Rs. 4-5 crores opening day as there would be a lot which would come from the single screens and advance booking data for that is not as transparent.This isn’t all as holdover release Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is seeing rapid advance booking as well with more than 50,000 tickets been sold. For a film, which is in its third week, Friday collections are set to be greater than last Friday of Rs. 3.21 crores with possibility of a stretch towards the Rs. 5 crores mark.All in all, between the three films, Rs. 15 crores is a given and there is a chance that a few more crores get added to this number. A big day indeed for Bollywood.

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film further consolidates on Sunday 
 
 
 Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:21:43 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is turning out to be a success and there is good consolidation happening in the second week. If the first week had found itself on a good ground after growing well over the weekend and then staying consistent during the weekdays with good spike on Valentine's Day, then the second weekend has shown good trending as well with a stable Friday, fiery Saturday and now a stable Sunday.This was evidenced in good collections of Rs. 6 crores more that came in. This means the collections have almost doubled over Rs. 3 crores which had been netted on Friday, and that's really good. It also means that from this point the weekdays would be good all over again and since the film has come on its own already, around Rs. 8 crores more can be expected to be added on to its overall score so far.The Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has already netted Rs. 55.97 crores and should now reach Rs. 70 crores pretty soon. In fact, a lifetime in excess of Rs. 75 crores is a given now and considering the fact that this one is a sci-fi romcom which has been a rather unexplored subject in Bollywood, it would be a good enough total overall.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Ulja Jiya Box Office: The film grosses Rs. 100 crores worldwide 
 
 
 Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:08:49 +0200 
 The subject of debut filmmakers Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah’s Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is as unusual as its title. Bollywood is known for making love stories, since time immemorial. But the film starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon is one of the most unusual love stories as it’s between a man and a robot. As the makers are saying, it’s ‘an impossible love story.’ Hence, the subject of the film was enough for the audience to take note of it.After releasing in theatres globally on February 9, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya has now crossed Rs. 100 crores gross at the worldwide box office. The movie achieved the feat yesterday February 19. Its worldwide total currently stands at Rs. 100.66 crores.To breakdown the figure, the film’s India gross number so far is Rs. 66.63 crores. The overseas number, on the other hand, is Rs. 34.03 crores. The total comes down to Rs. 100.66 crores gross.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya also stars Dharmendra, Dimple Kapadia, Rakesh Bedi, Anubha Fatehpuria, Rajesh Kumar, among others. The movie is produced under Dinesh Vijan’s banner Maddock Studios and Jyoti Deshpande from Jio Studios.Also Read: In her tenth year in Bollywood, Kriti Sanon hits the ball out of the park with Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya; a RARE actor who proves her worth as a performer through mainstream films and who doesn’t rely on hatke, art films to do so 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film grows over Thursday on Friday 
 
 
 Sat, 17 Feb 2024 11:50:40 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya scored an even better Friday than Thursday as it started its Week 2 campaign at the box office. On Thursday, the film had netted Rs. 3 crores and now on Friday it has gone up to accumulate Rs. 3.21* crores. This is good because usually there is at least a bit of a dip that comes in but here the numbers have gone up. Agreed that there is no new major release in theatres and also there is a weekend kick-start factor that comes in. Still, any sort of growth is always welcome and this is the kind of welcome trend that helps a film.It further goes on to show that how BOGO offer had a very limited role to play in the film's run and it’s the merits that are bringing in footfalls. Otherwise with no such offer on Friday, the collections would have read relatively lower. However that has not happened and with the collections going up instead, the footfalls are even stronger now.From here, it's all about the Saturday growth now. As was seen in case of Fighter in its second week, the film had grown quite well from Friday to Saturday, and that set the momentum well enough to allow it a good second week. Now the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer should also show good growth today and it has to be seen how big does it turn out to be. Further to that there should be consolidation on Sunday which means in its overall lifetime total, the sci-fi romcom should add on well over and above Rs. 50* crores that it has collected so far.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Does quite well, reaches almost Rs. 40 crores 
 
 
 Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:53:56 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is having a good run at the box office. After seeing an increase in numbers from Monday to Tuesday, the film came on its own on Wednesday when the collections zoomed up further. Agreed that it was Valentine’s Day but still at the end of the day it wasn’t national holiday. It was more of a celebration day amongst youth, especially couples, and still to have numbers grow massively over Tuesday was quite impressive.No wonder, with Rs. 6 crores coming in on Wednesday, the momentum is on the film’s side now. Something like this happens only when there is a national holiday like EDX. Still, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has grown and that shows that the film has been accepted by its target audience. Yes, there is a BOGO offer running alongside as well but none of that matters if a film isn’t accepted, and since there are enhanced footfalls already, it’s apparent that there is an audience for the film.The current score reads Rs. 38.97 crores for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya and to reach here in just 6 days is good because even if this had been a full week score, it would have been fine after the start of Rs. 7.02 crores that was taken. Now the film will, in fact, add onto that, which would set it up well for Week 2.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Comes close to Rs. 30 crores in its opening weekend 
 
 
 Mon, 12 Feb 2024 13:35:44 +0200 
 It has been a largely good weekend for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya as close to Rs. 30 crores have been scored. The good part is that the trending of the film has been positive and while a larger ratio of jump happened on Saturday, the fact that there has been some sort of increase in collections on Sunday as well means that there is a run that can be expected in theatres now.The film brought in Rs. 10 crores more on Sunday and that's far ahead of Rs. 7.02 crores that were collected on the day of release. This has resulted in the opening weekend standing at Rs. 26.52 crores which is far better than Zara Hatke Zara Bachke [Rs. 22.59 crores]. It had ultimately enjoyed a lifetime score of Rs. 88 crores. Now, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya would be aiming for a similar run as well, though for that the coming few days are going to be quite crucial.2024 has seen just a few releases so far and while Fighter has been the big one in January, the second biggest is Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya which promises to keep the month of February busy. There is a lot relying on the film to ensure that somehow a major chunk of the month goes by before Vidyut Jammwal's Crakk - Jeetegaa... Toh Jiyegaa along with Yami Gautam's Article 370 arrive on February 23 and then reignite spark at the box office. For that, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon needs to keep doing well and build on top of Rs. 26.52 crores that it has accumulated so far.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film gets into double digit score on Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 11 Feb 2024 13:45:55 +0200 
 It was a double-digit score for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya on Saturday as Rs. 10.50 crores came in. This was also the need of the hour since there is an open fortnight for the film and to leverage that to the maximum, a good jump in numbers on Saturday and Sunday was required. The good part is that this has come on Saturday at least with numbers jumping from Friday score of Rs. 7.02 crores, and while there would be a bit of an increment on Sunday as well, given the urban theme of the film one need to keep the expectations in check.The Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has now reached Rs. 17.02 crores and the logical next step would be for the film to hit the Rs. 30 crores milestone before the weekend is through. Since there is Valentine's Day coming on Wednesday, it acts as a mini-holiday of sorts and hence is expected to replicate the Friday number at least. This means the film does have potential to enjoy highs at multiple occasions in the first week run and a good Sunday jump will really help its cause.Last year, producer Dinesh Vijan's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke had started with Rs. 5.49 on its first day and then had a weekend of Rs. 22.59 crores before closing its first week at Rs. 37.35 crores. Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya has already seen a better first day [Rs. 7.02 crores] and will certainly have a better weekend as well as first week. What would eventually matter is whether the lifetime score of the Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali Khan starrer [88 crores] is surpassed too in the long run by Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya and for that the first week moolah will matter.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Telugu box office collections in 2023 were the HIGHEST ever but not a single Telugu film crossed the 300 cr. mark

 The Telugu film industry has been doing well for a long time but it got a boost with the success of Bahubali – The Beginning (2015). It was dubbed in Hindi and released extensively in cinemas. The experiment succeeded as the Prabhas-starrer was a big hit in the Hindi-speaking markets. It even got a great viewership on television. As a result, the craze was tremendous for the sequel, Baahubali 2 – The Conclusion (2017). It was also quite loved and for the first time, a film in Hindi crossed the Rs. 500 crore mark. Ever since, several South films have been dubbed into Hindi. Even the original Telugu language films continued to do well. Meanwhile, a perception was built that Bollywood has supposedly been boycotted while Telugu films do blockbuster business. The myth was broken last year when Hindi films did record business.In this special report, we shall take a look at the performance of the Telugu film industry in 2023. The collections in 2022 were Rs. 2,145 crores, the highest ever. The 2023 figure was even more at Rs. 2,265 crores.At the same time, however, when compared to 2022 and the performance of Hindi films in 2023, the domestic box office gross collections of Telugu films paled last year. In 2022, RRR was the biggest hit ever, collecting more than Rs. 500 crores in Telugu. The biggest Telugu grosser in 2023 was the Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. It collected Rs. 278 crores gross. In other words, the biggest film in Telugu last year didn’t cross the Rs. 300 crore mark.This was followed by Chiranjeevi and Ravi Teja-starrer Waltair Veerayya at Rs. 181 crores and Prabhas-starrer Adipurush at Rs. 153 crores. A lot was expected from the latter due to the casting of Prabhas and since it was based on the Ramayana. It did have a huge opening but collections soon came down as the word of mouth was very poor.The fourth and fifth positions were taken by Veera Simha Reddy (Rs. 109 crores) and Bhagavanth Kesari (Rs. 101 crores). Both these films starred Nandamuri Balakrishna.Telugu Domestic Box Office Footfalls

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film opens on a decent note, should have a good weekend 
 
 
 Sat, 10 Feb 2024 14:36:56 +0200 
 It was a decent beginning at the box office for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya as 7.02 crores came in. These are the kind of numbers that were expected in the first place and in that perspective, what the film has done is just apt.Of course, a double digit start would have been even better, something which used to be a norm for such kind of set up pre-pandemic. For instance, Badrinath Ki Dulhania [12.25 crores], Befikre [10.36 crores] and Half Girlfriend [10.27 crores] had opened much better and that too many years back. However, post pandemic romcoms like JugJugg Jeeyo [9.28 crores] and Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani [11.10 crores], which were set at a much bigger canvas (especially the latter) didn't really set the screens on fire on the very first day and grew on word of mouth.That's the kind of route that the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer would be looking at taking as well. Since it's an out and out urban film, the footfalls will primarily come from the multiplexes. The film benefits from the fact that it has two absolutely open weeks ahead of it and today the footfalls are already far better than yesterday already. This should set the stage for a reasonably good first weekend and from there it would be expecting good stability over the weekdays to take it through.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya likely to show 40% growth on Day 2; may end Saturday with Rs. 9-10 cr.

A projected 40% growth on Day 2 could propel Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya to a commendable Rs. 9-10 crore by the end of Saturday, marking a substantial leap from its opening day figures.Several factors contribute to the anticipated surge in box office performance on Day 2. Firstly, the positive word-of-mouth generated by early viewers is expected to attract more audiences seeking an engaging cinematic experience. Additionally, the weekend factor often sees an increase in footfall as audiences have more leisure time to visit theatres.

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Advance Booking Update: Shahid, Kriti film all set to be the big Valentine’s Day attraction; sells 18,000 tickets across National multiplex chains 
 
 
 Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:53:42 +0200 
 The Dinesh Vijan Production, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon is all set to be the big Valentine's Day attraction from the Hindi Film Industry. With less than a day left for the release, the advance booking of this robotic comedy is slowly gaining momentum in national multiplex chains. As of Thursday at 3 PM, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon film has sold approx. 18,000 tickets across the top 3 multiplex chains - PVRInox and Cinepolis.Being an urban film catering to the multiplex audience, this is a decent response for the film and puts it on the pedestal to take a reasonable start at the box office in India. The final advance bookings by 11.59 PM on Thursday is expected to be around 30,000 tickets, which puts it in the same zone as Shehzada and Bhediya surpassing the other films in similar space like Zara Hatke Zara Bachke.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, which is a family entertainer, is expected to open at Rs. 6.50 to 7 crore in India and then grow from there on basis the word of mouth. This would be a fair start but make it very important for this robotic comedy to trend well in the long run starting with a big jump in collections on Saturday and another healthy jump on Sunday.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is the first collaboration of Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon and is set to release on February 9, 2024. 
 Box Office Prediction: Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya to open in Rs. 5-7 crores range; to benefit from word of mouth 
 
 
 Thu, 08 Feb 2024 09:55:14 +0200 
 This Friday sees the release of Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya in theatres. The film was announced some time back and there was quite some intrigue around what would be the eventual title. Since there were hints that this one is a love story between a human and a robot, one expected something really 'hatke'. Hence, when it was eventually revealed as Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, it was rather interesting since in the current era, such kind of long titles bring back memories from the 90s when these were in vogue.Coming to the core of the film, this Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer is primarily relying upon the humor quotient, and every importantly, the music. With Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon coming together for the first time ever, the entertainment quotient had to be special and music too catchy. The promo gives a good enough indication for the former and as for the latter part, it's picking up well amongst the youngsters.The film releases at a time when audiences have been waiting for a family entertainer. It would be 15 days since the release of Fighter and while for the multiplex audiences there should be some unique proposition in the offering, for the masses it would be about catching fancy of the music and the lead pair, with the core content (love story between a human and a robot) relying upon word of mouth. As a result, the start of the film should be on a fair enough note with Rs. 5-7 crores on the cards, and post that it would be about word of mouth coming into play. 
 Two Tamil films crossed the Rs. 300 cr. mark in 2023 and 5 Tamil flicks did a business of Rs. 100 cr. plus 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 15:00:28 +0200 
 The Tamil film industry jumped back well after the pandemic, compared to the Bollywood film industry. 2022 was a great year thanks to the performance of films like Ponniyin Selvan - Part 1 and Vikram. Beast also put up huge numbers, though it underperformed later on. 2023, too, turned out to be an exceptional year for the South industry as the superstars once again pulled the audience to the cinemas.In this special report, we shall take a look at the performance of the Tamil film industry in 2023. As many as two films crossed the Rs. 300 crore mark domestically (gross). Thalapathy Vijay-starrer Leo emerged as the biggest Tamil hit of the year. In its original Tamil version, it collected a huge Rs. 328 crores gross in India. The tremendous hype, positive word of mouth, Lokesh Kanagaraj’s association as a director and of course Vijay’s starry presence all contributed to these huge numbers.This was followed by Rajinikanth’s Jailer, which collected Rs. 326 crores. The veteran star was loved in this film as a badass hero who teaches the goons a tough lesson. The hype for the film was also aided by Tamannaah Bhatia’s chartbuster song, ‘Kaavaalaa’.Thalapathy Vijay’s other film of 2023, Varisu, ended up with collections of Rs. 174 crores. Ponniyin Selvan - Part 2 took the fourth position, earning Rs. 162 crores. The period drama’s first part was released in 2022 and was the biggest Tamil hit that year, collecting Rs. 265 crores gross. The numbers of the sequel prove that it didn’t enjoy an encouraging word of mouth, compared to the first part.Ajith’s Thunivu, which incidentally clashed with Varisu, had collections amounting to Rs. 130 crores. These five Tamil films collected more than Rs. 100 crores plus in their original versions.The collections of all Tamil films domestically in 2022 were Rs. 1,724 crores, the highest ever. The 2023 figure was even more at Rs. 1,961 crores.Tamil Domestic Box Office Footfalls

 Fighter Box Office: Grows further over Saturday, stays above Rs. 10 crores mark again on Sunday 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 13:41:13 +0200 
 Fighter showed expected growth on Sunday as Rs. 11.50 crores came in. Yes, there was some sort of hope that maybe with a good push, the collections manage to hit the Rs. 10 crores mark at least once more in the film's run. It was always going to be difficult though since that Monday drop was really lethal. Still, there can always be miracles and that happened indeed for the film not just on Sunday but prior to that on Saturday as well.A double-digit score came on both the days and that has been a relief. Also, that has now pushed the film's case for an entry into the Rs. 200 Crore Club. That's what made both Tiger 3 and Dunki respectable because while the Salman Khan starrer, in fact, came close to even the Rs. 300 crores mark (and in the hindsight it all looks far better), the Shah Rukh Khan film also hit double century comfortably, and then collected some more, even though it was quite apparent that eventually even Rs. 250 crores would be a challenge for it.In case of Fighter, which is rather expensive, it would be interesting to see that how much farther than the Rs. 200 crores mark does it travel; more so since the quality of the content actually warranted that it enters the Rs. 300 Crore Club with ease. This is one of those cases when a good movie won’t reach out in an optimal way to the audiences. Currently standing at Rs. 166.50 crores, one waits to see if it somehow manages to push its way towards Rs. 225 crores lifetime.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Animal, Sam Bahadur, Dunki, Salaar effect: December 2023 was the BEST month ever for PVR Inox in the post-COVID era 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 10:43:59 +0200 
 A lot was expected from the Christmas 2023 releases – the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki and Prabhas-starrer Salaar. While both put up decent numbers, a lot more was expected from them. Nevertheless, the cinema exhibitors are not complaining, especially PVR Inox. It has come to light that for the largest multiplex chain, December 2023 turned out to be the best year ever in the post-Covid era.As per an article in The Economic Times dated February 1, Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, Executive Director, PVR Inox Limited, has been quoted saying that the months of October and November were muted due to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and lesser supply of films. But they had the best month ever in December once the World Cup fever ended in the second half of November.Sanjeev Bijli further said that Salman Khan’s Diwali release Tiger 3, Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal, which released on December 1, Dunki and Salaar were the highest-grossing films in the third quarter. He also added, “Even mid-budget films like Sam Bahadur and 12th Fail did very well and contributed to the overall box office.”As compared to the quarter last year, PVR Inox’s quarter jumped more than Rs. 11 times from Rs. 3.60 crores to Rs. 41.20 crores. As per The Economic Times article, this was mainly possible due to a sharp reduction in corporate tax. The corporate tax fell 78.50% - from Rs. 66.20 crores to Rs. 14.20 crores. The revenue grew from 6.40% to Rs. 1,569 crores and expenses increased from 7.8% to Rs. 1,343 crores.The story further revealed that as per the multiplex chain, the gross box office collections grew by 12% from Rs. 883 crores to Rs. 987.20 crores. In the third quarter of the previous financial year, there were 352 releases while in the current financial year’s Q3, the number of releases was just 209. It is said that the World Cup led to many makers avoiding this period.PVR Inox also made it clear that the results are not entirely comparable as both the multiplex chains were separate entities in 2022 and merged recently, on February 6, 2023.Lastly, the article informed readers that between April to December 2023, PVR opened 97 screens and shut down 62 screens. The latter happened because "(those) screens were opened 25 years ago which are in malls that have reached the end of their life cycles," said Sanjeev Kumar Bijli. Between January and March 2024, they plan to open 72 screens, of which 4 are already operational. One of the most awaited ones is the IMAX screen at Eros Cinema, Churchgate, Mumbai. 
 Fighter Box Office: Almost doubles up over Friday, has a good double digit Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 04 Feb 2024 18:54:13 +0200 
 Fighter is now doing some good business at major multiplexes of the country. Since the film is very urban centric, the footfalls are in accordance to that as well and that was apparent on Saturday as well. Especially at IMAX and 4DX properties, which attract a far more premium crowd, the shows were showing good occupancy, though the situation was a bit divided between 3D and 2D screens. This too was primarily the scenario at key properties across the country.That said, the fact that there has been very good growth over Friday numbers goes on to show that the film hasn't been rejected per se but it's just that the target audience is now at key urban centres. Those who have watched it are liking it; it's just that the horde of mass audiences which was expected to visit it in the first place didn’t come and that’s what impacted the weekdays.No wonder, the collections which have moved from Rs. 5.50 crores on Friday to Rs. 10 crores on Saturday are good and all eyes are on how much further than Rs. 10 crores will Sunday turn out to be. For a huge jump to happen again, it's the masses which need to come in big numbers on Sunday and in case of Fighter, the patronage is primarily coming from the class segment. The total of the film has now reached Rs. 155 crores and while Rs. 175 crores will be easily crossed by the close of weekend, it would be interesting to see if Rs. 180 crores mark is somehow surpassed as well.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Hanuman (Hindi) Box Office: Is marching towards Rs. 50 crores+ lifetime, will stay below 12th Fail though 
 
 
 Sat, 03 Feb 2024 16:52:14 +0200 
 It's going to be a 50 for HanuMan [Hindi]. The film is set to score in excess of Rs. 50 crores at the box office and it's a matter of a few more days before that eventually happens. After being in theatres for three weeks, the film now stands at 48.49 crores* after its fourth Friday. Just like Fighter, it too saw a big drop on Monday when collections came down to 36 lakhs. It did recover on a day by day basis with some increments in numbers but still, at the very least a score of over 50 lakhs was expected.This did happen on fourth Friday and that has pushed the score further. Now what it needs is a good jump in numbers today, something which had happened last weekend as well when the Republic Day holiday had really pushed it ahead and then Saturday and Sunday had stayed over the Rs. 1 crore mark. That's what's expected today and tomorrow as well and if the Rs. 1 crore mark is surpassed again on both the days then it would be really good. There is a chance of that to happen since Fighter has normalized already, which means there is space available for it.At one point it seemed that the Teja Sajja film will challenge 12th Fail lifetime but then that won't happen as the eventual lifetime will still stay below the Rs. 55 crores mark. That said, director Prasanth Verma has delivered a solid hit and it's nice to see a small film come from nowhere and give the month of January something to cheer about.*Estimates. Final numbers awaitedNote: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 12th Fail completes 100 days; industry at a loss of words at its MIRACULOUS run in cinemas: “The collections usually drop after a film’s OTT release. In 12th Fail, it didn’t and it’s unprecedented. There’s no explanation for this mania”

 The much-loved film 12th Fail, directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, has entered the 15th week in cinemas. Today, it completes 100 days and the manner in which it's running in cinemas is nothing short of a miracle. Believe it or not, the film continues to attract audiences in hordes in certain pockets, though it’s available on an OTT platform for more than a month. In its current work, it’s running in around 35 cinemas in Mumbai and 24 cinemas in Delhi-NCR. The show count is 4 times more than that of Ranbir Kapoor’s blockbuster, Animal.A manager from a leading multiplex chain told Bollywood Hungama, “12th Fail has grown from strength to strength. We expected that after the release of Animal, the footfalls would slide down. But that didn’t happen. Then, once Dunki and Salaar arrived and a week later, when the film premiered on Disney+ Hotstar, we were sure that it was the end of its run in cinemas. To our surprise, the film continued to get decent footfalls. Its shows rarely get cancelled due to zero audience. Log aa hi jaate hai. During weekends, we have seen near sold-out shows, that too in bigger screens.”Another staffer remarked, “12th Fail got a boost on social media once it came on OTT and memes and reels began to be made on its scenes and how amazing Shraddha (the female lead played by Medha Shankr) is. It seemed the aam junta felt motivated to catch this special film on the big screen rather than watching it at home. Otherwise, the collections usually drop drastically after a film’s OTT release. In 12th Fail, it didn’t happen and it’s unprecedented. There’s no explanation for this mania.”12th Fail collected under a crore in the 9th, 10th and 11th weeks. But in Week 12, it collected more than Rs. 1 crore, though it faced competition from Merry Christmas and Hanuman. A source said, “No one can predict whether or not it’ll do more than the previous week. There are times when multiplexes increase its shows looking at the demand and also if the new releases don’t perform as intended.”MovieTime Hub in Goregaon played 5 shows of 12th Fail in the open week of January 5-11, 2024. PVR Citi Mall in Mumbai replaced the evening show of Mohanlal-starrer Malayalam film Malaikottai Vaaliban with 12th Fail in the weekdays last week though as per sources, the former has performed decently.It now remains to be seen how long 12th Fail continues to run in cinemas. The source said, “As long as people come, multiplexes will be too happy to play the film. At this rate, we can’t rule out the possibility of it being a rare film in today’s time to complete 25 glorious weeks in cinemas.”In its 15th week, 12th Fail has seen an increase in shows. Since it completes 100 days, its tickets are priced at Rs. 100 for all shows until Thursday, February 8.12th Fail collections till date in India:Week 1: Rs. 13 crWeek 2: Rs. 14.11 crWeek 3: Rs. 8.54 crWeek 4: Rs. 6.41 crWeek 5: Rs. 6.62 crWeek 6: Rs. 2 crWeek 7: Rs. 1.50 crWeek 8: Rs. 1.50 crWeek 9: Rs. 0.50 crWeek 10: Rs. 0.35 crWeek 11: Rs. 0.65 crWeek 12: Rs. 1 crWeek 13: Rs. 0.57 crTOTAL: Rs. 56.75 crNote: All collections as per exhibition sources 
 Hollywood footfalls plummet to 4.80 cr. in 2023 in India, down from 5.10 cr. in 2022 
 
 
 Sat, 03 Feb 2024 11:00:37 +0200 
 Bollywood Hungama has recently provided data about the performance of films in India in 2023 across languages. It was observed that all the major industries like Bollywood, Tamil and Telugu had their best performance ever in terms of domestic box office gross, in 2023. Two major industries that suffered in 2023 were Hollywood and the Kannada industry. In this special report, we’ll be sharing information about the performance of Hollywood films in 2023.Hollywood films have been doing huge business since the last decade, exceeding expectations. The Marvel Cinematic Universe played a huge part in attracting moviegoers from across the country to cinemas. Avengers: Endgame (2019) unleashed a never-before-seen craze and it was the first Hollywood film to cross the Rs. 300 crore mark. In 2020 and 2021, Hollywood came to the rescue as most of our filmmakers felt that releasing films in theatres in Covid times was risky. Even in such conditions, few Hollywood films did huge business. Spider-Man – No Way Home (2021) embarked on a strong opening and ended up collecting Rs. 218.41 crores, despite the Omicron scare and 50% occupancy rule.2022 was also great as Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness and Thor: Love And Thunder got the benefit of the goodwill of Spider-Man – No Way Home and had very huge openings. Though the collections soon plummeted due to mixed word of mouth, the purpose was served. Avatar: The Way Of Water, meanwhile, was the biggest Hollywood hit of 2022, collecting a huge Rs. 378.22 crores.2023, sadly, saw no such Rs. 200 crores plus hit. The Marvel films performed underwhelmingly. There was also no spectacle like Avatar last year and this affected earnings as well as footfalls. But Oppenheimer proved to be a surprise. Despite being a film that was meant for the intelligentsia, it managed to emerge as 2023’s biggest hit. It collected Rs. 128.46 crores. This was followed by Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part One. As it collected Rs. 119.53 crores, it’s the first film of the series to cross the Rs. 100 crore mark. Fast X collected Rs. 108.83 crores. These are the only 3 films to have had a business of Rs. 100 crore. The next big grosser, John Wick: Chapter 4 collected Rs. 53.21 crores followed by Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 at Rs. 52.21 crores.The decline in box office earnings also resulted in lesser footfall. 2019 saw record footfalls at 9.70 crores. It slid down to 52 lakhs in 2020. 2021 was better at 3.28 crores. In 2022, the footfalls rose to 5.16 crores. In 2023, however, the footfalls reduced to 4.75 crores.It now remains to be seen how 2024 is for Hollywood in India and across the world. The absence of sufficient massy flicks can once again prove detrimental. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire looks the best out of the lot and has the potential to rock the show. Other potential hits include Furiosa, Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes, Ballerina, Deadpool 3 and above all, Joker: Folie à Deux. 
 Fighter Box Office: Hrithik Roshan starrer has a low extended first week 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 16:56:05 +0200 
 A well deserving film that should have actually soared quite high, Fighter has seen a low extended first week at the box office. The collections were a little short of the Rs. 150 crores mark as they stood at 148.35 crores. This is disappointing because so much more was expected out of it. In fact, these are the kind of numbers that should have actually come in the extended weekend itself but unfortunately the drop was too heavy on Monday.The collections kept seeing a bit of a drop on a day-by-day basis, though thankfully there wasn’t any more big crash. On Thursday, the film brought in 5 crores more and hopefully today too the collections will stay over the Rs. 5 crores mark. Once that happens then some sort of growth can be expected over rest of the weekend. These are the three days when, in fact, maximum moolah will come for the film since from Monday onwards the collections will get into that Rs. 2-3 crores range and post that, new films will start arriving which will curtail its run.
This is a good film that definitely deserved a better run and one can certainly expect Siddharth Anand and Hrithik Roshan to be disappointed. There was a lot that went into the making of the film and it’s a good enough entertainer as well. Unfortunately, the film didn’t reach out to the audience in a way it should have and hopefully it will eventually happen on its OTT premiere.

 Box Office 2023: Punjabi films grossed Rs. 235 crores, Marathi films grossed Rs. 201 crores, Bengali films grossed Rs. 66 crores in 2023 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 11:00:34 +0200 
 Of late, Bollywood Hungama has reported on the box-office performance of Bollywood, Hollywood, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada cinema in 2023. In this article, we shall discuss the box-office figures of Punjabi, Marathi and Bengali films in the domestic market.Punjabi films had a historic 2019 as collections went up to Rs. 249 crores, the highest ever. In 2020, the figure was a mere Rs. 19 crores while it was Rs. 91 crores in 2021. 2022 was a bit disappointing as the total collections were Rs. 147 crores.2023 figures were the second best of all time as it jumped to Rs. 235 crores. It is lesser than the 2019 numbers but the signs of improvement are there. The footfalls also grew from 1.50 crores in 2022 to 2.3 crores in 2023, which is almost at par with 2017 levels (2.3 crores). The biggest hit of the year, Carry On Jatta 3, was also the biggest Punjabi hit ever, collecting Rs. 54 crores gross. This was followed by Mastaney (Rs. 33 crores) and Kali Jotta (Rs. 21 crores).The Marathi box-office performance, meanwhile, was underwhelming. It went on a record high of Rs. 268 crores in 2022. But the figure reduced to Rs. 201 crores in 2023. Footfalls are also down from 2.60 crores in 2022 to 2 crores in 2023.2023 saw Marathi cinema delivering Baipan Bhari Deva, which exceeded all expectations. Backed by Jio Studios, this woman-centric film collected Rs. 92 crores gross in cinemas. It is also the second-biggest Marathi grosser of all time. Sadly, this was the only major blockbuster of the year. The second biggest grosser, Subhedar, collected Rs. 18 cores. Jhimma 2 collected as much as the first part - Rs. 14 crores. It suffered from mixed word of mouth and if the reports were encouraging, it had the potential to cross the Rs. 20 crores mark. What's unfortunate is that a film like Vaalvi got all-round acclaim and yet, it didn't even cross the Rs. 10 crores mark.The Bengali industry similarly saw a drop in collections - from Rs. 77 crores in 2022 to Rs. 66 crores in 2023. While the footfalls were 70 lakhs in 2022, it was 60 lakhs a year later. Chengiz, the Eid release which was also the first Bengali film to release in Hindi, was the biggest hit of 2023 followed by Raktabeej and Dawshom Awbotaar. 
 Fighter Box Office: Hrithik Roshan starrer stays at Rs. 6 crores on Wednesday 
 
 
 Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:31:23 +0200 
 After seeing a huge drop on Monday, Fighter has somehow managed to stay stable - albeit on a lower side - in days to follow. This was evidenced on Wednesday too when the collections came to Rs. 6 crores. Of course, given the credentials of the film, this isn’t the kind of number that anyone associated with it would have expected since a double-digit score was a given right till the close of extended first week. However, when Monday itself went way below the Rs. 10 crores mark, then it was all about survival with the best possible.The Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor film now stands at Rs. 143.35 crores, and the overall collections would stay a few lakhs below the Rs. 150 crores mark by close of extended first week. There would be a bit of a drop today as well and then it’s all about the kind of hold that it manages on second Friday. Post that, it will boil down to the rise in numbers over the weekend and the best that can happen is that at least on Sunday, the film reaches a double-digit score.Siddharth Anand’s first collaboration with Hrithik Roshan was Bang Bang and that film had earned Rs. 181 crores back in 2014. The first aim would be to go past that number at least on an absolute scale (since accounting for inflation and ticket prices, this number will be rather high). Due to an open week ahead, this should happen eventually, though unfortunately Rs. 200 Crores Club entry would be extremely tough.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Box Office 2023: Cinema halls in 2023 achieved a whopping footfall of 94.30 crores with an Average Ticket Price of Rs. 130 
 
 
 Thu, 01 Feb 2024 11:00:54 +0200 
 In a recent article, we mentioned how the domestic gross box office collections in 2023 were the highest ever. For the first time, the Rs. 12,000 crore mark was breached and the total earnings from all films across languages was a huge Rs. 12,230 crores. In this special feature, we shall take a look at the domestic footfalls.As expected, the footfalls were much better than in the last three years. In 2017, for the first time, the footfalls crossed the 100 crore mark, with the final figure closing at 101 crores. The footfalls dropped slightly in 2018 to 94.50 crores. But it jumped to a record 103 crores in 2019.In 2020, the pandemic resulted in the closure of cinema halls for most parts of the year. Though theatres were allowed to resume operations from October, the fear of going to the theatres was high. This directly affected the footfalls. It plummeted to 22.50 crores. 2021 was slightly better at 42.7 crores.In 2022, theatres began operations in a full-fledged manner. The fear went away as the number of cases dropped and moviegoers were ready to go back to the theatres. As a result, the footfalls rose to 89.20 crores. And in 2023, it increased to 94.30 crores.What’s interesting to note is that it has not yet reached the 2018 levels yet but considering the situation post-pandemic, the 2023 figure is encouraging. What also needs to be considered is that though the footfalls are the third highest ever, the box-office earnings last year were the best ever. This shows that the average ticket price (ATP) also increased substantially which helped in the increase in collections.In 2023, the ATP was Rs. 130. It’s higher than the ATP in 2019, that is, Rs. 106. In the pandemic years, the ticket prices were slashed to lure the audience. The ATP in 2020 and 2021 were Rs. 91 and Rs. 87 respectively. It jumped to Rs. 119 in 2022, which was also a record high and in 2023, even this figure was breached.Even when it comes to ATP, it differs as per the language. Hollywood films are mainly targeted at the elite crowd and are also released in premium formats like IMAX, 3D, 4DX etc. As a result, the ATP for Hollywood was Rs. 237. Some of the biggest Hindi films, too, were released in these formats and its ATP was Rs. 196. In the Tamil and Telugu-speaking markets, there’s control over ticket prices and there, the audience enjoys films at reasonable prices. The ATP for Telugu and Tamil movies were Rs. 94 and Rs. 89 respectively. Malayalam movie’s ATP was lesser at Rs. 85 while for Kannada, it was more, at Rs. 103.Domestic Footfalls (in crore)

 After a record 2022, Kannada cinema saw a STEEP decline in box office numbers in 2023; not a SINGLE film crossed even the Rs. 70 cr. mark; footfalls down from 8.1 cr. to 3.2 cr.

 Bollywood Hungama recently provided data about the performance of films in India in 2023 across languages. It was observed that all the major industries like Bollywood, Tamil, and Telugu had their best performance ever in terms of domestic box office gross, in 2023. Two major industries that suffered in 2023 were Hollywood and the Kannada industry. In this special report, we’ll be sharing information about the performance of Kannada films in 2023.The Kannada cinema industry has been growing steadily and got a boost with the blockbuster success of KGF - Chapter 1 (2018). The sequel, KGF - Chapter 2 (2022) was an even bigger hit. Other films, too, performed well and one expected 2023 to be another stellar year. Sadly, the business dropped to alarming levels.In 2018, the domestic box-office gross collections of all Kannada films was Rs. 383 crores. It jumped to Rs. 522 crores. 2020 was bad for all industries due to Covid restrictions and Kannada was no exception. The total collections stood at a mere Rs. 41 crores. It jumped to Rs. 374 crores in 2021 and went on a record high of Rs. 810 crores in 2022.Sadly, in 2023, the business came down to Rs. 312 crores. Hence, it is less than the collections in the last 8 years, sending shockwaves into the industry.What also added to the shock that not a single Kannada film crossed the Rs. 100 crore mark. In 2022, two films entered the Rs. 100 crore club - Kantara and James. KGF - Chapter 2 even breached the Rs. 200 crore mark.But in 2023, the biggest hit was Kaatera, starring Darshan, Aradhana Ram and Jagapathi Babu. It collected Rs. 67 crores gross domestically. This was followed by Kranti at Rs. 41 crores. Kabzaa takes the third position, which collected a mere Rs. 30 crores and was a box-office disaster. Shiva Rajkumar’s Ghost collected Rs. 22 crores. Sapta Saagaradaache Ello – Side A, which got a lot of acclaim, took the fifth position as it earned Rs. 21 crores.As for the footfalls, 2019 was the best ever at 7.3 crores. The number slipped to 60 lakhs in 2020. It then jumped to 4.40 crores and 8 crores in 2021 and 2022 respectively, the latter being the highest ever.

 Music Review - One Night Stand 
 
 
 Thu, 14 Apr 2016 14:24:52 +0200 
 EXPECTATIONSSunny Leone's Ek Paheli Leela had good songs. Now that she is in a central role again in One Night Stand, one expects some good music on play, especially with a diverse team of composers (Tony Kakkar Meet Bros, Vivek Kar, Jeet Ganguly) and lyricists (Kumaar, Shabbir Ahmed, Manoj Muntashir) coming together. With Jasmine D'Souza making her debut as a director, one also expects some good sensibilities on display when it comes to the film and its music.MUSICThe album kick-starts on a winning note with Tony Kakkar putting together 'Do Peg Maar' with Kumaar. One Night Stand gets a cracker of a start with this foot tapping party number that has chartbuster written all over it. Oh yes, it does follow the template of 'daaru' and 'nasha'. However, for a film which is set to cater to an adult audience, this was pretty much on the cards as well. Expect this one to play on.It is time for some melody soon after with Meet Bros coming up with 'Ijazat'. A beautiful composition which has some characteristic singing by Arijit Singh, this one pretty much follows the template when it comes to the kind of love songs that are expected from T-Series in the current times. With simple lyrics by Shabbir Ahmed, 'Ijazat' moves at a slow pace with easy going music that helps it to stay on loop.What happens next is a not-so-pleasant surprise as Jasmine Sandlas croons 'Ishq Da Sutta'. Leaving aside the fact that it is in total contrast to the lovelorn mood that had been created with 'Ijazat', the composition by Meet Bros is hardly impressive while Kumaar's lyrics are way below what one expects from him. While Meet Bros. come behind the mike as well, the song can't be expected to have much of a life unless the choreography turns out to be exemplary and turns around the scene entirely.Vivek Kar and Kumaar come together for the sad song 'Ki Kara' which has Punjabi undertones to it. Crooned by Shipra Goyal, this one has Western fusion element making it sound like Punjabi pop. A situational track that typically finds its way in the second half of the film, expect this one to play in the background while the montages are on.Jeet Ganguly comes on the scene with 'Le Chala' and actually delivers the best song of the album. Sung quite effectively by Jubin Nautiyal, this one is also written quite well by Manoj Muntashir, even as the protagonist wanders in the hunt for love. Expect this one to truly go well with the film's narrative as it has the kind of depth to it that only riches the overall soundtrack of One Night Stand.The soundtrack turns further interesting with Dev Negi sung 'Tum Mere'. Poetically written by Kumaar, this one has some good music by Vivek Kar and only makes one wonder why this one hadn't come earlier in the album. Quite easy on ears, 'Tum Mere' is situational as well but manages to hold quite well. Impressive.OVERALLOne Night Stand has the kind of music that you would hear beyond just one night!OUR PICK(S)'Le Chala', 'Do Peg Maar', 'Ijazat', 'Le Chala' 
 Music review of Aamir by Joginder Tuteja 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Jun 2008 12:56:07 +0200 
 Sometimes a small film can make a huge impact. For no particular reason, somehow one feels that Aamir would be one such film. Even though the film arrives sans any media hype or promotion, there is something about this production that makes one look forward to what does the film and its music have to offer. Though one doesn't expect the film's lead Rajeev Khandewal to be dancing to the tunes created by Amit Trivedi with lyrics by Amitabh, there are expectations of a quality soundtrack in the offering which would go well as a part of the background score.Welcome to a Qawalli outing with Murtuza-Qadir, Amitabh and Amit Trivedi teaming up behind the mike for 'Ha Raham (Mehfuz)'. Instead of a conventional Qawalli with a regular sound, 'Ha Raham' indeed takes a different route. Though the essence remains just what one expects from a Qawalli, it is the serene feeling, some powerful lyrics and soulful singing which makes it a cut above the rest. One wishes the track is placed appropriately in the film's narrative for the maximum impact. 
In his next song for Aamir, Amit Trivedi takes a folk route and creates the kind of sound that one has been exposed through the band Euphoria or Kailash Kher. Amit also comes behind the mike for this fast paced number that stays attached to its ethnic route with some unconventional lyrics that make one study the song closer. It would have been interesting had a music video been created around it. Amit continues to play the twin role of composer and singer with 'Haara' and this time around he modulates his voice to go with the soft rock mood of the song. The song manages to create a haunting environment that goes well with the kind of psyche that the lead protagonist in the film is going through. There is a segregated sound in this 4:30 minutes song which doesn't follow a linear musical pattern and instead concentrates on the terrible situation that protagonist finds himself in. 'Phas Gaya (Never Mind)' is the best song of the enterprise to come after 'Ha Raham'. An innovative piece of music which has a western base to it, 'Phas Gaya' is crooned excellently by Neuman Pinto who does perfect justice to the new age sound created by Amit Trivedi. Yet again a track which takes an audience into the mind of the lead protagonist, it has a pop feel to it and is a good hear even outside the film's narrative. For the first time in the album, a female voice is heard once 'Ek Lau' begins. Shlipa Rao is the chosen one as she pairs up with Amitabh for this number that hardly has an instrument in the background for most part of its ~five minutes duration. Yet again, Amitabh spins poetry for this song which has a sad theme to it. Towards the end of the song, Amitabh makes his presence felt with his repeated rendition of 'Ek Lau Zindagi Ki Bujhi Kyon Mere Maula'. Finally comes the climax theme by Marianne D'Cruz Aiman & Jeetendra Thakur (who plays the violin). A six minute piece which has an international base to it and is paced quite slowly to bring on a haunting feel to the proceedings, the climax theme here is different from the kind that one normally associates with a Bollywood product. Truly different and spell binding, it would ensure that no one moves when it plays for the big screen. Lastly, there are bonus songs from Khuda Kay Liye ['Allah', 'Bandya O Bandya'] and Kailash Kher's 'Dilruba' and 'Chaap Tilak' which bring the album to a close. Aamir isn't a kind of album which would make much impact the music stands. However, the kind of sound it carries may work well with those who are looking for something unconventional in the offering. Amit Trivedi and Amitabh do well in sticking to the film's genre and create a soundtrack which goes well with the film's theme. 
 Music review of Naya Daur by Joginder Tuteja 
 
 
 Sat, 04 Aug 2007 12:59:37 +0200 
 "How one album has such a huge number of chartbuster tracks?" - This is the first thought that comes in mind while looking at the inlay card of Naya Daur! And this is when you also realize why lyricist Sahir, composer O.P. Nayyar and director B.R. Chopra are treated as legends!With Naya Daur, they made a film which is relevant even today while adding songs that are still loved and known by all. If in 50s, Naya Daur dealt with a battle between man and machine, 50 years down the line it is still valid as the debate has reached the next level with comparisons between machines and computers! Nevertheless, one plays on the album to revisit the classics from the era that has gone by.We just heard Pritam incorporating the 'mukhda' of 'Uden Jab Jab Zulfen Teri' in Alisha Chinoy rendered 'It's Rocking' for Kya Love Story Hai. Now revisit the classic track in it's original form with Mohd. Rafi and Asha Bhonsle coming up with an unmatchable camaraderie to create a classic. This is what you actually term as a 'feel-good' song. Rhythm, melody, pace, arrangements - just everything works in perfect harmony as O.P.Nayyar creates a tune which would be remembered for 50 more years to come.Same would hold good for ever-so-naughty 'Reshmi Salwar Kurta Jali Ka' which still continues to be a favorite. One can sense a kind of continuity from 'Uden Jab Jabâ€¦' to 'Reshmi Salwarâ€¦' when one observes the orchestra of the two tracks closely. There is a certain similarity to the earthy manner in which the songs have been composed which results in a consistent flow for the album. While Asha Bhonsle makes us believe once again that she has truly been active for more than half a decade, it is nostalgia time to hear Shamshad Begum.Now this is a kind of tune that has been replicated/duplicated/attempted by many a composers over the decades though with hardly the similar results! Composed for a situation where the lead pair of the film are professing their love for each other atop a horse cart, 'Maang Ke Saath Tumhara' is an utterly romantic number which will stay on to be a landmark song of the century gone by. Mohd. Rafi and Asha Bhosle sealed their association as a duet pair with this song which has a deadly combination of rhythm and melody to make it one of it's kinds.'Dil Leke Daga Denge' lasts merely 100 seconds which makes you wonder why the song wasn't composed as a full blown 4-5 minutes duration conventional track? For the first time in the album there comes a song which doesn't follow a happy mood and makes you feel sad along with the protagonist. Mohd. Rafi's voice makes one miss the legend once again and shows once again that how imitators have hardly managed to create a similar feel in spite of repeated attempts.It's time to get into a patriotic mode as the ever-so-popular 'Ye Desh Hai Veer Jawanon Ka' makes an entry. An extended one and a half minute 'dhol' piece at the very start restates the point that it is not just Yash Raj Films which has used this musical instrument so very effectively in the music of their films. From this point on Mohd. Rafi takes over as he sings a track which is a MUST requirement for each and every wedding celebration up North India. Even though the song is about appreciation of India and Indians, there is something about it which makes people jump on the streets and dance to it regardless of the purpose of celebration.Call it the beauty of work done by O.P. Nayyar and Sahir that in the very opening lyrics of the song it is made clear that 'Main Bambai Ka Babu' is a 'Hindustani song rendered in a Western style'! While one relishes the peppy tune, what turns out to be most remarkable is Mohd. Rafi's rendition as he gets into a completely different mood when compared to each of the other songs he has rendered so far. Sheer versatility - that's all one can exclaim for the legend.A social number, 'Saathi Haath Badhana', comes next. With the spirit of togetherness embedded in the song, 'Saathi Haath Badhana' reminds of 'Chale Chalo' from Lagaan which was based on a similar theme. Since the song doesn't belong to the romantic genre, Mohd. Rafi, Asha Bhonsle along with the chorus singers too modulate their voices accordingly to go with the theme of the song. The proceedings are much more sober and serious this time around even though O.P. Nayyar's touch is prevalent throughout the track's duration.The album ends with Rafi's solo 'Aana Hai To Aa'. A devotional track about waiting for the almighty to get things in order over the period of time, it has a strong classical base to it and deviates from the mostly feel good approach that the songs preceding it had taken. Instead the song takes the listener into a pensive mood as one looks forward to revisiting the situation in the film for which the song must have been composed.It would be irrelevant to call this piece as a review. With the songs being played on for five decades with generations before us appreciating it for it's quality, it would be sacrilege to even try finding gaps in the compositions or analyzing it as a pseudo critic. Instead, what makes sense is to simply enjoy the beauty of the tracks and talk about the overall 'experience'!Rating: Classic!

  SHAITAAN is a nail-biting thriller laced with superlative performances Movie Review: SHAITAAN is a nail-biting thriller laced with superlative performances  
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 09:08:19 +0200 
 Star Cast: Ajay Devgn, R Madhavan, Jyotika, Janki Bodiwala, Anngad RaajDirector: Vikas BahlSynopsis:
SHAITAAN is the story of a family in crisis. Kabir (Ajay Devgn) resides in Dehradun with his wife Jyoti (Jyotika), daughter Janvi (Janki Bodiwala) and son Dhruv (Anngad Raaj). They head to their farmhouse for the weekend and on the way, they bump into Vanraj (R Madhavan). He befriends the family and wittily feeds a sweet to Janvi. Immediately, Janvi comes under Vanraj's spell. Sometime after they reach the farmhouse, Kabir and his family find Vanraj at their doorstep. Jyoti gets suspicious but Vanraj assures them that he needs help to charge his mobile phone. Janvi, who's still under his spell, blurts out her secrets to him. When Vanraj attempts to overstay, Kabir tries to oust him. But shockingly, Janvi violently stops him from kicking Vanraj out of the farmhouse. The family is shocked to see Janvi blindly following all the orders of Vanraj. Vanraj soon makes his intentions clear - he wants Kabir and Jyoti to give away Janvi to him. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Shaitaan Movie Story Review:
SHAITAAN is the official remake of the 2023 Gujarati film, VASH [Written and directed by Krishnadev Yagnik]. The adapted story is excellent and different from the rest of the films based on black magic. Aamil Keeyan Khan's adapted screenplay is very engaging. And it’s a feat considering the genre is beaten to death across the world and also because it’s majorly set in one mansion. Sadly, the writer doesn’t tie the loose ends properly. Aamil Keeyan Khan's dialogues are normal and very select one-liners pack a punch.Vikas Bahl's direction is first-rate. He keeps the viewers captivated in the proceedings especially once things take a turn for the worse. One feels moved by the situation of the family and one can't help but root for them. Also, the tension levels are there throughout the film and it also helps in engaging the audience.On the flipside, there are too many cinematic liberties. To see characters getting brutally injured and yet to see them not just surviving but also fighting back gets a bit too much. The climax battle seems predictable. Also, it's bewildering to know Vanraj pulling off his plan and no one getting a whiff about it. The last scene is interesting but could have been better written.SHAITAAN begins with an eerie credit animation that sets the mood. The intro shot is lovely and looks very organic. The madness begins once Vanraj innocently introduces himself to the family. Two scenes that stand out in the first half are Janvi playing violently with her brother on the swing and the police sequence. The intermission comes at a crucial juncture. In the second half, the madness continues as Vanraj ups his game while the family also tries to outsmart him. The finale keeps one at the edge of the seat, despite the shortcomings.Shaitaan Movie Performances:
SHAITAAN belongs to R Madhavan and Janki Bodiwala. R Madhavan steals the show with his venomous act. He has that innocence in him and hence, it looks believable when Kabir and his family don’t get suspicious about him initially. In the second half, he takes his act many notches higher. Janki Bodiwala gets into the skin of the character. A flawless performance, for sure. Ajay Devgn, too, puts his best foot forward and puts up a superb act. He’s sure to be greeted with claps and whistles in the climax. Jyotika lends able support and gives a natural performance. The same applies for Anngad Raaj. He’s quite funny in the initial scenes.Shaitaan Movie music and other technical aspects:
Amit Trivedi's music is okay and all the songs of the film - the title track, 'Aisa Main Shaitaan' and 'Khushiyaan Bator Lo' - are in sync with the theme. Amit Trivedi's background score is one of the USPs of the film.Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is praiseworthy, considering it's set in just one house. The camerawork in the swing sequence is exceptional. Garima Mathur's production design is appealing. Radhika Mehra's costumes are rich. Vikram Mor and R P Yadav's action is a bit disturbing but it's appropriate for the story. Sandeep Francis's editing is smooth but could have been slicker in the second half.Shaitaan Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, SHAITAAN is a nail-biting thriller laced with superlative performances and clapworthy climax that keeps you engaged. At the box office, the film is set for a good opening thanks to the well-received trailer, hype and partial holiday on account of Mahashivratri. What will also go in the film’s favour is that after a long time, an A-lister like Ajay Devgn will be seen in this genre. 
  Movie Review: DUNE: PART TWO is a big-screen spectacle 
 
 
 Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:36:59 +0200 
 Star Cast: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Rebecca FergusonDirection: Denis VilleneuveDune: Part Two Movie Story Review:
DUNE: PART TWO is the story of a warrior. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) defeats Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) and gets accepted into the clan along with his pregnant mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Some Fremen members have reservations about their entry into their clan. But Stilgar (Javier Bardem) tries to convince some of the members that he might be the Prophet who will help them defeat the Harkonnens. Paul slowly begins to learn the way of the Fremen. He and the other warriors fiercely attack Harkonnen soldiers and even their spice fields. Rabbon (Dave Bautista) tries his best but is unable to defeat them. This is when Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) sends his fierce nephew Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) to Arrakis to teach the Fremen a lesson. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The story is fascinating and well-detailed. Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts's screenplay is effective and neatly merges all the subplots together. A few dramatic scenes are very well written. However, in some scenes, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are conversational, and a few one-liners are powerful.Denis Villeneuve's direction is exemplary. He handles the grandeur beautifully and ensures that it doesn't look like similar big-scale films of recent times or even in the past. The makers take a lot of care about the character arcs and the changes they go through seem organic. A few scenes that stand out are the opening fight scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) on the desert trip together, Paul riding the sandworm, Feyd-Rautha's entry and the climax.On the flipside, the film is too long at 167 minutes. A few scenes are repetitive and hence, the impact also diminishes. The villain gets introduced in a grand fashion but in the second half, he gets a raw deal. Also, throughout the film, the powerful Harkonnens don't seem to be using all their powers to get back at Fremen.Dune: Part Two Movie Performances:
Timothée Chalamet, as expected, gives a wonderful performance but watch out for him in the second half. One has never seen him in such an avatar. Zendaya thankfully has considerable screen time, and she lights up the screen with her presence and performance. Austin Butler makes a strong impact with his performance, despite late entry. Rebecca Ferguson is a surprise as her character goes through a major change and she has done a fine job. Javier Bardem is dependable. Stellan Skarsgård is apt for the role while Dave Bautista is okay. The others who do well are Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), Christopher Walken (Emperor) and Léa Seydoux (Lady Margot Fenring).Dune: Part Two Movie music and other technical aspects:
Hans Zimmer's music, like always, enhances the impact. Greig Fraser's cinematography is top-notch. Patrice Vermette's production design is world-class. The same applies to Jacqueline West's costumes. Joe Walker's editing should have been sharper.Dune: Part Two Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, DUNE: PART TWO is a big-screen spectacle but could have had a slicker and shorter second half. At the box office, the immense hype among the urban audience can help the film become a success. 
  Movie Review: LAAPATAA LADIES works due to the plot, performances, and some scenes. 
 
 
 Wed, 28 Feb 2024 09:32:52 +0200 
 Star Cast: Sparsh Shrivastava, Nitanshi Goel, Pratibha RantaDirector: Kiran RaoSynopsis:
LAAPATAA LADIES is the story of a missing bride. On January 29, 2001, Deepak Kumar (Sparsh Shrivastava) marries Phool (Nitanshi Goel). Both board the unreserved compartment in the Belpur Katariya Express. He sits next to two other newly married couples. All the brides have covered their faces with ‘ghoonghat’. When his destination – Murti station – arrives, Deepak grabs the hand of a woman, who he believes is Phool, and gets down. He takes her to his village, Surajmukhi. His family members and neighbours are in a festive mood. But they get the shock of their lives when they open the veil and they realize that Deepak has accidentally brought another woman with him. This second bride turns out to be Pushpa Rani (Pratibha Ranta). She claims that the name of his groom is Pankaj and that she is from a village named Sambela. The next day, Deepak goes to the police station to file a complaint. The cop in charge, Shyam Manohar (Ravi Kishan), is initially amused by the goof-up. But he soon realizes that Pushpa Rani might not be as innocent as she claims. Meanwhile, Phool is stranded at Pateela railway station. Here, she befriends a tough but kind-hearted tea stall owner, Manju Maai (Chhaya Kadam), who teaches her important life lessons. What happens next forms the rest of the film.
Laapataa Ladies Movie Story Review:
Biplab Goswami's story is unconventional and amusing. Sneha Desai's screenplay adds to the entertainment quotient. At the same time, it also raises some important points. Sneha Desai's dialogues (additional dialogues by Divyanidhi Sharma) are funny and also quite sharp and hit the right chord.Kiran Rao's direction is uncomplicated and captivating. The narrative is easy to understand while the characters are straight out of life. The humour is infused in an organic manner; not a single dialogue or punch seems forced. The story could have seemed unconvincing or flawed but Kiran makes sure that it looks believable why the bride got lost and why she was not able to reunite with her hubby. As the story progresses, Kiran touches upon certain social aspects plaguing society. Yet again, it seamlessly becomes a part of the goings-on. The character of Manju Maai is a masterstroke in this regard. Kiran Rao reserves the best for the finale. It is clapworthy, to say the least.On the flipside, though the director ties all loose ends, she misses one – Pushpa’s hubby had spotted Phool at the station and ideally, he should have informed the cop about it. It would have made the investigation easier. Secondly, the angle of MLA Mani Singh is hilarious. However, it serves no purpose to the story as the MLA and his speech are forgotten. Lastly, the buzz is very limited and this can impact its box office collections.Laapataa Ladies | Official Trailer | Aamir Khan Productions Kindling Pictures Jio Studios
Laapataa Ladies Movie Performances:
LAAPATAA LADIES belongs to both the leading ladies. Nitanshi Goel’s innocence is her biggest strength and she enhances it with her supreme performance. Pratibha Ranta is quite confident and plays her part with panache. Sparsh Shrivastava, too, puts his best foot forward and gets into the skin of his character. Chhaya Kadam is terrific and delivers a National Award-worthy performance. Ravi Kishan, too, rocks the show and only, an actor of his calibre would have done justice. Rachna Gupta (Poonam; Bhabhi) and Geeta Agrawal Sharma (Yashoda; Deepak's mother) leave a mark. Satendra Soni (Chotu) and Abeer Jain (Bablu) are adorable. Bhaskar Jha (Pushpa's husband Pradeep), Daood Hussain (Gunjan), Durgesh Kumar (Dubey ji; cop) and Kanupriya Rishimum (Bela; cop) are fine.
Laapataa Ladies Movie music and other technical aspects:
Ram Sampath's music is lovely but won’t have a shelf life. 'Doubtwa' and 'Beda Paar' are quirky. 'O Sajni Re' is soulful while 'Sajni' is fair. Ram Sampath's background score is in sync with the film's mood.Vikash Nowlakha's cinematography gives the film a straight-out-of-life feel. The locales are fresh and never before seen in any film. Vikram Singh's production design is quite real. Darshan Jalan's costumes are authentic. Jabeen Merchant's editing is smooth but could have been slicker.Laapataa Ladies Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, LAAPATAA LADIES works due to the amusing plot, performances, underlying message and some memorable funny and emotional scenes. At the box office, it has the potential to grow with each passing day. 
  Movie Review: CRAKK fails to deliver the desired impact. 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:55:50 +0200 
 Star Cast: Vidyut Jammwal, Arjun Rampal, Nora Fatehi, Amy JacksonDirector: Aditya DattSynopsis:
CRAKK is the story of a reckless, brave man. Siddhart Dikshit aka Siddhu (Vidyut Jammwal) resides in Mumbai with his father (Rajendra Shisatkar) and mother (Shalaka Pawar). His elder brother Nihal (Ankit Mohan) died while participating in an extreme sports competition called Maidaan. Siddhu also likes to do risky stunts and his parents ask him not to indulge in it as they don't want him to die like his elder brother. Their plea falls on deaf ears and Siddhu sends his stunt videos to the Maidaan team. The organizer of Maidaan, Dev (Arjun Rampal), likes his videos and enlists him for the next edition. Siddhu travels to Poland illegally with the help of Dev's team. He's taken to the facility of Maidaan where he meets the rest of the 31 players. He also bumps into an influencer, Alia (Nora Fatehi), and sparks fly between them. The next day, the games begin. Siddhu manages to emerge victorious and get to the next round. The same night, Siddhu and Alia go out to celebrate. This is when Siddhu is confronted by Patricia (Amy Jackson), an Intelligence official. She asks Siddhu to spy on Dev and whether he's smuggling or transporting dangerous material with the money generated from Maidaan. Siddhu is forced to comply; or else, she would have deported him back to India for entering Poland without a valid visa. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review:
Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's story is promising. Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's screenplay, however, doesn't make the desired impact as it's stretched, silly and also delves into subplots needlessly. Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's dialogues are massy but a few one-liners are childish.Aditya Datt's direction is okay and it suffers as the writing is weak. On the positive, he handles the grandeur well and also the grand action set pieces. The scenes of all three races are very captivating. The intro scene is also nail-biting.On the flipside, the film's biggest issue is the length. At 156 minutes, it is too long for a film of this kind. Secondly, the film is not just about the competition. Between the three races, a lot happens and it is not exciting. It would also leave viewers scratching their heads. For instance, Siddhu badly wanted to be a part of Maidaan and earn the prize money. Hence, he had no solid reason to agree to help Patricia, especially after she let him go back to the facility. The intermission point is laughable. The track of Dev and his father Mark (Bijay Anand) isn’t effective, except for the scene where they have vodka. Siddhu spying in the facility of Dev without getting caught is unconvincing. The climax fight is tedious and the twist that occurs at this point leaves viewers frustrated instead of feeling wowed.Performances:
Vidyut Jammwal is his usual self and looks quite cool in performing the death-defying stunts. Arjun Rampal puts up a fine act but gets over the top in some scenes. Nora Fatehi oozes charm and is fair. Amy Jackson is decent but her accented Hindi looks a bit forced. Ankit Mohan delivers a confident performance. Rajendra Shisatkar, Shalaka Pawar and Bijay Anand lend able support. Jamie Lever (Junaida) leaves a huge mark. Zack (Michael Owusu) is okay. Pooja Sawant and Rukmini Maitra look sizzling in the end credit song.Music and other technical aspects:
The music is well-woven into the narrative. The title track is very catchy. 'Jeena Haraam' and 'Khayal Rakhna' are forgettable. 'Rom Rom' is played in the end credits and does register. But it looks out of place. Vikram Montrose's background score enhances excitement.Mark Hamilton's cinematography matches international standards. Federico Cueva, Kerry Gregg, Dr. K. Ravi Verma, Cyril Raffaelli, Dawid Szatarski, Raj Shinde, Sunil Rodrigues and Vikram Dahiya's action is the best part of the enterprise. Somya Chauhan, Gabriella Demetriades, Trushala Nayak and Anushka Tugnait's costumes are stylish. Juhi Talmaki's production design is functional. VFX is tacky. Sandeep Kurup's editing is loose. The film should have been shorter by 20-30 minutes.Conclusion:
On the whole, CRAKK fails to deliver the desired impact and is too lengthy. At the box office, the lack of buzz and competition from ARTICLE 370 is likely to impact its collections. 
  ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale Movie Review: ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:06:34 +0200 
 Star Cast: Yami Gautam Dhar, Priya Mani, Vaibhav Tatwawadi, Skand Thakur
Article 370 Movie Review: ARTICLE 370 is a gripping taleDirector: Aditya Suhas JambhaleSynopsis:
ARTICLE 370 is the story of two women who changed history. On July 8, 2016, Zooni Haksar (Yami Gautam Dhar) of the Intelligence Division finds out crucial information that a dreaded terrorist, Burhan (Shivam Khajuria), is hiding in Kokernag, Kashmir. She asks her senior, Khawar Ali (Raj Arjun), for permission but he instructs her to wait. Zooni chooses not to and executes the operation with the help of CRPF officer Yash Chauhan (Vaibhav Tatwawadi) and his team. Burhan is killed and it angers a section of political leaders. They provoke the youth, leading to violence in the Valley. The Intelligence Division suspends Zooni for not following orders. She is shifted to Delhi where she goes into depression. A year later, Rajeshwari Swaminathan (Priya Mani), of the PMO, approaches Zooni and invites her to lead a team in the National Investigative Agency (NIA) in Srinagar. Zooni accepts the offer though she makes it clear that all their efforts would not lead to any concrete result as long as Article 370 exists. The Union Government soon breaks the alliance with Parveena Andrabi (Divya Seth Shah) in Kashmir. They also impose President's Rule, thus ensuring that leaders of different political parties don't unite to form a coalition. Rajeshwari soon confesses to Zooni that the Centre plans to revoke Article 370. But they need to find a way to do so legally and at the same time, ensure that Peace is not disturbed in the Valley. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Article 370 Movie Story Review:
Aditya Dhar and Monal Thaakar's story, inspired by true events, is exciting. Everyone is aware that Article 370 was abrogated but no one knows how it was carried out. Aditya Dhar, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, Arjun Dhawan and Monal Thaakar's screenplay (additional screenplay by Aarsh Vora) is gripping. The writing becomes a bit technical in places but the writers compensate for it with some entertaining and thrilling moments. Aditya Dhar, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, Arjun Dhawan and Monal Thaakar's dialogues are powerful and clapworthy.Aditya Suhas Jambhale's direction is captivating. The film is 160 minutes long but doesn’t get boring or lengthy as a lot is happening every minute. The makers adopt a no-nonsense and realistic approach and it gives the film a nice touch. The first half doesn’t pack a punch, as intended, but post-interval, the film gets much better. The scene where Zooni interrogates Yakub Shaikh (Sumit Kaul) will be loved by the masses. The episode on how a crucial piece of information was deleted from a legal document is quite a shocker. Two tracks run simultaneously in the climax and both are entertaining and captivating.On the flipside, though the makers have tried their best to simplify the narrative, a few details might be difficult to decipher. Hence, those expecting it to be a conventional entertainer might be a bit disappointed. Secondly, in places, the film gives a feeling of being one-sided and not covering all elements of the story. For instance, Article 370 was revoked for the betterment of the people of Kashmir. However, the aam junta and their hardships are never focused in the film, except for the scene of a sarpanch (Middat Ullah Khan). Lastly, the assassination attempt in the climax is nail-biting but it also raises the question of whether it actually happened in real.Article 370 | Official Trailer | Yami Gautam Dhar, Priyamani | Jio Studios | B62 StudiosArticle 370 Movie Performances: 
Yami Gautam Dhar yet again delivers a power-packed performance. In fact, this is her most accomplished performance. She is quite convincing in the action and interrogating scenes but watch out for her in the emotional scenes. The manner in which she delivers the monologue in the first half gives goosebumps. Priya Mani keeps her act restrained, as per the character requirement and is apt for the part. Vaibhav Tatwawadi is quite likeable. Raj Arjun and Skand Thakur (Wasim Abbasi) lend able support. Sumit Kaul, Salahuddin Jalal (Raj Zutshi) and Rajiv Kumar (Shamsher Abdali) leave a huge mark. Divya Seth Shah and Irawati Harshe Mayadev (Brinda Kaul) are decent. Kiran Karmarkar (Home Minister) is superb and takes the entertainment quotient of the film many notches higher. Asit Redij (Opposition leader Rohit Thapar), too, puts his best foot forward. Arun Govil (Prime Minister) is okay and it seemed like he was trying too hard. Janya Khandpur (Sabia), Middat Ullah Khan, Mohan Agashe (Jagmohan Patil) and Ashwini Koul (Zakir Naikoo) are fair.Article 370 Movie Music and other technical aspects:
Shashwat Sachdev's music doesn't register. Ideally, ARTICLE 370 should have been a song-less film. But Shashwat Sachdev's background score is kickass and very different from the usual BGMs.Siddharth Vasani's cinematography is breathtaking and uncomplicated in action scenes. Sujeet Subhash Sawant and Sriram Kanan Iyengar's production design is rich. Veera Kapur Ee's costumes are realistic yet stylish. Parvez Shaikh's action is not gory at all. Identical Brains's VFX is acceptable. Shivkumar V Panicker's editing is smooth.Article 370 Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale that attempts to depict an important chapter of India’s history in an entertaining and simple manner. At the box office, the topic of the film and the trailer has caught attention. Moreover, the film releases on a day when tickets are available for just Rs. 99. As a result, it can open strongly and emerge successful at the box office in the long run, provided it enjoys a good word of mouth. 
  Movie Review: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE boasts of a bravura performance by Kingsley Ben Adir 
 
 
 Fri, 16 Feb 2024 17:26:45 +0200 
 Star Cast: Kingsley Ben-Adir, Lashana Lynch, Anthony WelshDirector: Reinaldo Marcus GreenSynopsis: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE is the story of a legendary artist. The year is 1976. Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir) is a successful singer and is based in Kingston, Jamaica with his family and band. This is a time when Jamaica is under a political crisis. Bob decides to have a peace concert. It leads to objections from those with ulterior motives. Bob, his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch) and brother Don (Anthony Welsh) are attacked one day at their residence. They survive but it leaves Bob shocked. He asks Rita and the children to move to his mother's place in Denver, USA while he moves to Europe. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review: Terence Winter and Frank E Flowers' story is inspiring and a tale waiting to be told. Terence Winter, Frank E Flowers, Zach Baylin and Reinaldo Marcus Green's screenplay, however, is unexciting and inconsistent. Dialogues are okay. Jamaican English is difficult to comprehend and thankfully, the studio has provided subtitles.Reinaldo Marcus Green's direction is insipid. On the positive side, the main character is fleshed out nicely. The film begins on a dramatic note and the confrontational scenes are well executed. The songs are effortlessly woven into the narrative.On the flipside, the film moves at a very slow space. Once Bob moves to Europe, the narrative loses its purpose, and you wonder where the film is heading. The flashback childhood portions further hamper the impact, except the one where Bob and his band get to record their first song. Some developments are not properly explained. One also can’t help but draw parallels with musical biopics like BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY [2018] and ELVIS [2022], which focused on the music as well as the ups and downs in the lives of the protagonists. BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE clearly failed to reach that level.Performances: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE belongs to Kingsley Ben-Adir. The actor gets into the skin of the character and delivers a flawless performance. The film becomes watchable, thanks to him and the way he has got the nuances right. Lashana Lynch doesn't have much to do initially but later on, shines. Anthony Welsh leaves a mark. James Norton (Chris), Brian Todd Boucher (Claudie), David Marvin Kerr Jr (Junior Marvin) and Michael Gandolfini (Howard Bloom) are alright. The actors who play the kids are wasted.Music and other technical aspects: Kris Bowers's music is classic, and the film consists of some of the best tracks of Bob Marley. The ones that are well utilized in the film are 'Get Up Stand Up', 'I Shot The Sheriff', 'War', 'Exodus' and 'Redemption'. Kris Bowers's background score is subtle. Robert Elswit's cinematography is appropriate. Chris Lowe's production design is authentic. Anna B Sheppard's costumes are reminiscent of the bygone era. Action is fair. Pamela Martin's editing is painfully slow.On the whole, BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE boasts of a bravura performance by Kingsley Ben-Adir. But due to poor execution, slow pace and negligible buzz, it will struggle to find an audience. 
  Movie Review: MADAME WEB doesn't work due to the faulty script and execution 
 
 
 Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:26:18 +0200 
 Star Cast: Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar RahimDirector: S J ClarksonSynopsis:
MADAME WEB is the story of a young woman who turns saviour for three teenage girls. In 1973, Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) heads to the Peruvian Amazon in the eighth month of her pregnancy to research spiders that have healing properties. After a lot of effort, she finds the spider. However, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), her guard, snatches away the spider from her to get powers. He also shoots Constance before fleeing. Suddenly, members of the Las Arañas tribe arrive and they try to save Constance. In the process, she delivers a baby girl and then dies. 30 years later, Constance's daughter, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is working as a paramedic in New York City. One day, she realizes that she can see the future. Meanwhile, Ezekiel is also in New York and he gets visions of being killed by three masked women. He steals surveillance technology from a National Security Agency official and uses it to find them. He realizes that the women he saw in his dreams are actually teenage girls - Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). They are not related to each other and in a strange coincidence, they happen to be at the same place. Meanwhile, Cassie also sees the future wherein Ezekiel is trying to kill the girls. She bumps into the trio and escapes with them before Ezekiel can lay his hands on them. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review:
Kerem Sanga, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless's story is clichéd. Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and S J Clarkson's screenplay is engaging but is silly and will leave the audience puzzled as there are too many bewildering and confusing moments. The dialogues are ordinary and there are barely one or two memorable lines. A film like this ought to have had some funny and witty dialogues.S J Clarkson's direction is not upto the mark. It offers nothing novel and the film comes at a time when the audience is fatigued of superhero movies. The director does try to creatively depict scenes where Cassie sees the future and then goes back in time. But it doesn't make you go 'Wow' as intended. The energy in the climax scene is also off and is no way nail-biting, that it should have been.On the positive side, the scene where Cassie tries to form a bond with the girls is entertaining. The revelation about the mother in the second half is unpredictable.Performances:
Dakota Johnson genuinely tries to rise above the substandard script and gives a fine performance. Sydney Sweeney, too, puts her best forward. Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor lend able support. Tahar Rahim is over the top and is let down by the writing. Also, why on earth was he given a Spider-Man suit? Kerry Bishé, José María Yazpik (Santiago; Las Arañas tribe member) and Adam Scott (Ben Parker) leave a mark. Emma Roberts (Mary Parker) and Mike Epps (O'Neil) are okay. Zosia Mamet (Amaria; Ezekiel’s assistant) is expressionless.Music and Technical:
Johan Söderqvist's music has the typical superhero feel. Mauro Fiore's cinematography doesn't give any reason for complaint. Ethan Tobman's production design is rich while Ngila Dickson's costumes are stylish. VFX is not appealing. Action is appropriate. Leigh Folsom Boyd's editing is fair.Conclusion:
MADAME WEB doesn't work due to the faulty script and execution. At the box office, it'll have a tough time due to the negativity and poor reviews.

But since Pallavi is younger, the mother wants Iraa to marry first. Iraa shares her predicament to Heer. Heer reveals that he’s also under pressure to get hitched. He sees this as a golden chance to propose marriage to Iraa. She agrees but makes it clear that she'll clear her IAS exams and only then, will she consider being a mother. Heer agrees. After marriage, her life turns upside down in no time as the Chawlas pester her to do household as well as office work. A few months pass. One day, Heer goes to the supermarket with Rajjo. Rajjo sees Heer buying pickle and also feeling nauseous. She assumes that Rajjo is pregnant. She tells her family and they break into a celebration. Iraa tells Heer not to tell his family the truth. She realizes that knowing that she is expecting, the Chawlas won't let her do any work. Thus, she'll get all the time in the world to study. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Kuch Khattaa Ho Jaay Movie Story Review:Vijay Pal Singh's story is flawed and senseless. Raajj Salluja, Niket Pandey, Vijay Pal Singh and Shobhit Sinha's screenplay is devoid of logic and common sense. It's shocking how it even got approved. Niket Pandey and Shobhit Sinha's dialogues are nothing great. But a few liners elicit laughs.G Ashok's direction is nothing special and it's shocking that someone who made a film like BHAAGAMATHIE [2018] fail so miserably to compensate for the loopholes in the script. From the very beginning, the goings-on gets on your nerves. On one hand, the Chawla family members want to see Iraa work hard for the IAS Exams. But the very next moment, they start demanding that she should do household chores and also office work. Then the way Rajjo assumes that Iraa is pregnant, without even asking her once, will leave the audience stunned. The first half at least had some funny scenes to keep the interest going. After the intermission, the film turns serious and the twist at this hour further ruins the film. Also, in the second half, the film gets slow and hence, it'll be a pain for viewers to sit till the end.Kuch Khattaa Ho Jaay (Trailer): Guru Randhawa, Saiee Manjrekar | Anupam KherPerformances:Guru Randhawa is too raw and needs to polish his acting skills. Saiee Manjrekar is decent and pulls off her performance well. Anupam Kher is dependable, as always. Ila Arun tries her best but her character is irritating and hence, her performance also suffers. Atul Srivastava and Paresh Ganatra lend able support. Paritosh Tripathi succeeds to some extent in making viewers laugh. Brahmanandam (Dhamkeshwar) plays a hilarious character but he’s let down by the script.Music:Music doesn’t have a shelf life. 'Jeena Sikhaya', 'Jhol Jhal' and 'Iss Baar Jo Chale Gaye' get registered a bit. 'Bottley Kholo' is played during the end credits. Vijay Verma, Anamik Chauhan and Lyton's background score is in sync with the film's theme.Technical:R M Swamy's cinematography is nothing great and to show the Taj Mahal every now and then, just because the film is set in Agra, can put off viewers. Prameet Saini and Divya Gupta's costumes are rich, especially the ones worn by Saiee Manjrekar. Rahul Sharma's production design is akin to that of a TV show. Dhiraj Kumar Wadhwa's editing is nothing special.Conclusion:On the whole, KUCH KHATTAA HO JAAY is a senseless saga and will leave a very sour taste in the mouth of the moviegoers. 
  Bhakshak Movie Review: BHAKSHAK is a no-nonsense gripping investigative thriller. 
 
 
 Fri, 09 Feb 2024 16:56:08 +0200 
 BHAKSHAK is an investigative thriller. The year is 2018. Vaishali Singh (Bhumi Pednekar) is a journalist who resides in Patna with her husband Arvind (Surya Sharma). She and Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra) run a small-time news channel called Koshish News. One day, an informer, Gupta (Durgesh Kumar), hands her a social audit report that states that the condition of the girls’ shelter home at Munawwarpur, Bihar is deplorable. It also states that the orphan girls have been physically abused in this home. The report was delivered to the government two months ago and yet, they haven't taken any action or initiated an inquiry. Vaishali and Bhaskar head to Munawwarpur and realize that the shelter home is run by the powerful politician, Bansi Sahu (Aditya Srivastava). Vaishali even meets the Child Welfare Committee official, Mithilesh (Chittaranjan Tripathy) who feigns ignorance. Meanwhile, Bansi learns that Vaishali is trying to investigate his shelter home. He calls Arvind and warns him of dire consequences if she doesn’t stop. Despite knowing the risks, Vaishali plays the news on her channel. She visits shelter homes in Patna and other towns of Bihar to get some leads. But none of the shelter homes had any young girls who had previously stayed at the Munawwarpur shelter home. Finally, she meets a prime witness. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's story, inspired by a true incident, is superb. It also works because not many are aware of this episode. Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's screenplay is captivating for most parts although the pace overall could have been quicker. Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's dialogues pack a punch, especially the monologue of Bhumi Pednekar.Pulkit's direction is exemplary. He approaches a no-nonsense approach, and the focus of this 135-minute-long film is on the principal story. Thankfully, he doesn’t try to titillate and yet, manages to show the horrors happening in the shelter home. The plot also reminds one of the Oscar-winning film SPOTLIGHT [2015] but the dangers faced by the journalists here are grave and hence, the tension levels are quite high. The makers also raise some important issues and give a nice tribute to the unsung heroes of the media in rural India who are putting their lives at risk to break stories for the betterment of society. The film begins on a chilling note and some of the memorable scenes are Vaishali blasting her husband, Sudha’s (Tanisha Mehta) flashback and the scene at the hospital. The climax is exhilarating.On the flipside, the film moves at a slow pace. A few scenes will leave the audience bewildered like the attempt to frame Mithilesh. And though the makers try their best to justify, it’s still unconvincing that Bansi or his men didn’t try much to silence Vaishali or Bhaskar.Speaking of performances, Bhumi Pednekar delivers one of the best performances of her career. She carries the film on her shoulders strongly and understands the part correctly. Sanjay Mishra is extremely adorable, and he is also responsible for the laughs in the film. Watch out for his body language and non-verbal expressions and you realize that he’s a powerhouse of talent. Aditya Srivastava is terrific and essays the role of the antagonist with panache. Sai Tamhankar (SSP Jasmeet Gaur) leaves a huge mark but has limited screen time. Durgesh Kumar is entertaining. Surya Sharma lends able support. Gulista Alija (Baby Rani) is a talent to watch out for. The same applies to Tanisha Mehta. Chittaranjan Tripathy, Vibha Chibber (Rajni Singh), Pravin Kumar Sisodia (Brijmohan Singh), Shakti Sinha (Pappu Thekedar), Danish Iqbal (Suresh Sinha; Vaishali's brother-in-law) and Pubali Sanyal (Mamta; Suresh Singh's wife) are great.Bhakshak | Official Trailer | Bhumi Pednekar, Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava &amp; Saie TamhankarSongs are not of chartbuster variety. 'Ganga' and 'Chanda' are okay. 'Shaamil' won't have a shelf life but is played at an important juncture and is powerfully worded. Clinton Cerejo and Bianco Gomes' background score is impactful.Kumar Saurabh's cinematography is marvellous, and he makes good use of the lights and hues. Prashant Bidkar's production design is impressive, especially the shelter home. Veera Kapur Ee's costumes are non-glamorous, as per the requirement. Zubin Sheikh's editing is sharp but could have been crisper.On the whole, BHAKSHAK is a no-nonsense gripping investigative thriller and rests on the powerful performances of Bhumi Pednekar, Sanjay Mishra and Aditya Srivastava. It also gives a nice tribute to the small-town journalists who often risk their lives while trying to break stories that matter. 
  Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Movie Review: TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA rests on the fine performances 
 
 
 Fri, 09 Feb 2024 13:05:56 +0200 
 TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA is a love story between a man and a robot. Aryan (Shahid Kapoor), based in Mumbai, is a robotics engineer at E-Robotics. His family is based in Delhi and is behind him to get married. His maternal aunt Urmila (Dimple Kapadia) is a reputed senior employee at E-Robotics and she calls Aryan to her office in the USA for a project. The day Aryan reaches the USA, Urmila flies to Belgium for urgent work. She tells Aryan that her manager, Sifra (Kriti Sanon), will take care of him. Aryan meets Sifra and sparks fly between them. They get intimate and the next day, Urmila returns. She confesses to Aryan that Sifra is a robot and that the former purposely hid this information from Aryan to check whether the latter was able to guess the truth about Sifra. Aryan is shocked and even devastated as he has fallen in love with Sifra. He cuts short his USA trip and returns to India to get away from Sifra before he falls in love with her even more. He even agrees to marry the girl of his family's choice. Unable to get Sifra out of his mind, he devises a plan. He calls Urmila and asks her to send Sifra to India as an experiment and to see how she reacts to madcap members of their family. As soon as Sifra arrives in India, he announces to his family that he's marrying her. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's story is novel. Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's screenplay is breezy but it's not consistent and is quite weak in the climax. Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's dialogues are well worded but not all jokes land well.Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's direction is okay. They understand the grammar of family films and add the required drama, romance and emotions. The chemistry between the characters is also neatly established. The robot angle is dealt with in a simple and non-complicated manner. A few scenes stand out like Aryan apologizing to Sifra, Aryan learning that Sifra is a robot, the intermission point, Sifra downloading a corrupt software, Aryan persuading Urmila on the day of his marriage etc.On the flipside, some scenes that were meant to induce laughter like the intro scene, Aryan experimenting with a man named Dubey etc fail in their endeavour. The sequence where the men get drunk is where the makers try too hard to be funny. The chaos and madness that the makers wanted to highlight in a joint family didn’t come out as planned. The biggest issue, however, is the climax. It is abrupt and sudden and the way it unfolds will leave the audience shocked. The message is understandable but from the execution point of view, it falters miserably. The promise of a sequel fails to correct the minuses.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya | Official Trailer | Shahid Kapoor and Kriti SanonShahid Kapoor looks super-dashing and dances like a dream. His performance is spot-on, especially his comic timing. He also excels in the emotional scenes. Kriti Sanon is adorable and gets her act right. It is not easy to portray a character that has robot-like features but can pass off as a human being and in this regard, she comes out with flying colours. She especially shines in the second half. Dharmendra has limited screen time and is cute. Dimple Kapadia leaves a mark, as expected. Ashish Verma (Monty) lends able support. Rajesh Kumar (Mama) raises a few laughs. Anubha Fatehpuria (Sharmila; Aryan's mother), Rakesh Bedi (Mama) and Grusha Kapoor (Babli Bua) don’t get much scope. Raashul Vijay Tandon (Pappu) and Brij Bhushan Shukla (Goldie; doctor) are decent. Rajan Kavatra (Inspector Gupta) and Manish Kumar (Constable Gujjar) are funny.The music is of chartbuster variety. 'Laal Peeli Akhiyaan' is foot-tapping and is well choreographed. 'Akhiyaan Gulaab' and 'Tum Se' are lovely. The title track is played during the end credits and is catchy. Sachin-Jigar's background score is in sync with the film’s theme.Laxman Utekar's cinematography is neat. Mayur Sharma's production design is rich. Sukriti Grover's costumes for Kriti Sanon and Anisha Jain's costumes for Shahid Kapoor are very stylish and appealing. Aejaz Gulab and Manohar Verma's action is not too gory. Redefine's VFX is praiseworthy. Manish Pradhan's editing could have been slicker.On the whole, TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA rests on the fine performances of Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon but suffers due to the writing and an abrupt climax. At the box office, its prospects will be limited only to a section of the multiplex going audience. 
  Argylle (English) Movie Review: ARGYLLE is a disappointing fare 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 12:48:03 +0200 
 ARGYLLE is the story of a writer being chased by a dangerous organization. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a successful spy novelist, who has written five volumes of Argylle. It's about a secret agent named Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) and his adventures. Elly's fans are stunned not just by the edge-of-the-seat narrative in her books but also by how the events depicted have later happened in real life. She gets stuck while writing the sixth part and decides to meet her parents to get fresh ideas. While she is travelling on the train, she meets a dishevelled passenger Adian (Sam Rockwell). He reveals himself to be an actual spy and that her life is in danger. She rubbishes it off but the next second, she gets attacked by goons. Adian rescues her and then explains how the happenings in her books have raised eyebrows, especially the hacker angle. He also informs her that a real-life hacker, Bakunin (Stanley Morgan), was supposed to deliver a digital file, containing important information, to Adian at Albert Memorial, London. However, he never turned up. Adian asks Elly to switch on her thinking cap and guess why Bakunin was a no-show and where he must have kept the file. The goons, who attacked Elly, belong to the ‘Division’, a criminal organization, headed by Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They also wanted to locate the file and hence, they tried to kidnap Elly. Adian’s mission is to now save Elly from the Division and retrieve the file. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Jason Fuchs's story has a novel touch and could have been made for a great spy thriller. Jason Fuchs's screenplay is promising but later, it goes all over the place. Jason Fuchs's dialogues are decent and could have been funnier.Matthew Vaughn's direction has his trademark stamp. On the positive side, the beginning portions are entertaining and fascinating, especially the chase sequence in Greece. The manner in which a docile novelist gets chased by dangerous henchmen and the bond she forms with the 'good spy' makes for a superb watch. What also adds to the novelty is Elly assuming Argylle, from her novel, is the one who's fighting, instead of Adian. Both the train sequence and the attack at the hacker's hideout keep the interest going.But then the way the film falls in the second half will leave viewers shocked. From an original, wacky entertainer, the film becomes cliched and also childish. Elly's flashback is far from convincing. The whole 'hypnosis' angle is silly and it's shocking how it got approved. The film ends with the promise of a sequel, but it won't leave the audience excited.Speaking of performances, Bryce Dallas Howard plays the lead part with conviction. Sam Rockwell, as expected, is dependable and entertaining. Samuel L Jackson (Alfred Solomon) is damn good, as always. Henry Cavill looks suave but sadly, he's hardly there. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara (Ruth; Elly's mother) are fair. Sofia Boutella (Saba Al-Badr) is wasted. The same goes for Ariana DeBose (Keira); it's sad that an actress of her calibre is given an inconsequential role. Dua Lipa (LaGrange) is rocking in a cameo. The same applies to John Cena (Wyatt).Lorne Balfe's music is typical. George Richmond's cinematography adds to the cinematic feel. Russell De Rozario and Daniel Taylor's production design is rich. Stephanie Collie's costumes are rich, especially the golden gown worn by Bryce Dallas Howard in the second half. The action is slick. VFX matches global standards. Tom Harrison-Read and Lee Smith's editing is decent though the run time of 139 minutes is too much.On the whole, ARGYLLE is a disappointing fare with a silly second half. At the box office, it has got a wide release in India. But due to negligible ticket sales and poor word of mouth, it might face a massive reduction of shows from Saturday. 
  Next Goal Wins (English) Movie Review: NEXT GOAL WINS is an entertaining flick, based on a real event 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 12:20:30 +0200 
 NEXT GOALS WINS is the story of a coach coaching a 'team of losers'. In 2001, American Samoa's football team suffers a humiliating defeat after they lose 31–0 to Australia. 10 years later, in 2011, a hot-headed Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), is asked to join as the coach of American Samoa by the American Soccer Association. With no other option, he takes up the job reluctantly; or else, he would have got fired. His aim is to get American Samoa to perform well at the 2014 World Cup qualification, scheduled to be held three weeks later. But the American Samoa is at the bottom in the world rankings. Since its inception, it hasn't scored a single goal ever. Thomas is frustrated as he realizes that the team lacks discipline and techniques to play the game. What happens next forms the rest of the film.NEXT GOALS WINS is based on true events. The story is fascinating. Taika Waititi and Iain Morris' screenplay is simple and light. The writers pepper the film with lots of funny moments and also some touching scenes at the end. The dialogues are conversational and also hilarious.Taika Waititi's direction is neat. He keeps the focus on the story and also doesn’t go into a biopic zone of sorts, that is, the story focuses only on American Samoa’s performance in the 2011 match and how they prepped for it. Hence, the duration is kept in check at 104 minutes. The humour quotient works big time and it’s amusing to see the coach getting frustrated while trying to teach the game to the players. There’s also a lovely message towards the end.On the flipside, the makers set expectations high with the priest (Taika Waititi) assuring viewers in the beginning that they won’t be able to believe that the events, shown in the film, happened in reality. Although the event is inspiring, it’s not as unbelievable as was promised. The film stagnates in the middle and also, it reminds of films like CHAK DE INDIA [2007], JHUND [2022] etc. Lastly, it gets a very late release in India.Speaking of performances, Michael Fassbender is superb and apt for the part. Oscar Kightley (Tavita; president of Football Federation American Samoa) is adorable. Kaimana (Jaiyah) is too good as the transgender player. Her track adds a nice touch to the goings-on. David Fane (Ace; previous coach), Elisabeth Moss (Gail; Thomas' ex-wife) and Semu Filipo (Rambo; cop) leave a mark. Uli Latukefu (Nicky Salapu) is introduced in a heroic fashion but doesn't have much to do. Beulah Koale (Daru Taumua) and Ioane Goodhue (Smiley) don't get much scope.Michael Giacchino's music is appropriate. Lachlan Milne's cinematography is spectacular. The lensman captures the daily life on the island beautifully. Ra Vincent's production design is realistic. Miyako Bellizzi's costumes are authentic. Nicholas Monsour's editing is slick.On the whole, NEXT GOAL WINS is an entertaining flick, based on a real event. However, due to the delayed release in India and similarities with CHAK DE INDIA and JHUND, the film might not find many takers in India. 
  Fighter Movie Review: FIGHTER is a paisa vasool patriotic entertainer  
 
 
 Thu, 25 Jan 2024 13:39:20 +0200 
 FIGHTER is the story of a brave Air Force unit and their adventures. The year is 2019. With Pakistan intensifying operations against India, the Indian Air Force sets up a new unit called Air Dragons. It comprises Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania aka Patty (Hrithik Roshan), Squadron Leader Minal Rathore aka Minni (Deepika Padukone), Squadron Leader Sartaj Gill (Karan Singh Grover), Squadron Leader Basheer Khan (Akshay Oberoi), Sukhi (Banveen Singh) and others. It is headed by Rakesh Jai Singh aka Rocky (Anil Kapoor), who detests Patty due to a past incident. The unit members bond well and also train themselves for any eventuality. Patty and Minni get attracted to each other. On February 14, 2019, they are sent to Jammu for an operation. On the way, they come across a contingent of CRPF jawans and the Air Dragons unit briefly interacts with them. Later, the Air Dragons officers learn that those CRPF officers were killed in a suicide attack at Pulwama. India decides to fight back. Patty heads the mission and successfully destroys a militant base at Balakot in Pakistan. Pakistan is stunned by the development. This is when they are provoked into taking action by a terrorist mastermind, Azhar Akhtar (Rishabh Ravinder Sawhney). Patty fights back with his team but it has disastrous consequences. He’s also compelled to face his past demons. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Siddharth Anand and Ramon Chibb's story is a bit clichéd but is well-written and the aerial aspect gives a nice touch to the overall film. Ramon Chibb's screenplay is terrific and very engaging. The characters are well-fleshed out and also, the conflict is explained in a simple manner. The writing, however, could have been tighter. Hussain Dalal and Abbas Dalal's dialogues (additional dialogues by Biswapati Sarkar) are witty, funny and massy in some very important scenes.Siddharth Anand's direction is slick and supreme. The blockbuster filmmaker knows the pulse of the audience and also how to add scale and grandeur to a film. As a result, the film makes for an ideal big-screen experience. This was expected from him but what would surprise the audience is that this time, Siddharth delivers a mainstream film which is high on emotions. His earlier works, WAR [2019] and PATHAAN [2023], too, had some touching scenes. But in FIGHTER, he has taken this aspect to another level. And it works big time as the audience gets invested in the goings-on deeply and wants the heroes to emerge triumphant.On the flipside, there’s very little action in the first half of the post-interval portion. Also, the film gets a bit lengthy at this point. Moreover, the product placement is quite in the face. Lastly, the villain track is not convincing and is very over the top.FIGHTER doesn’t waste any time and the story moves forward from the first scene. Minni’s entry scene is great but watch out for Patty’s entry. Some might draw parallels with Hrithik’s entry shot in WAR but nevertheless, it makes an impact. The comic scenes that follow keep the interest going, especially Patty asking for Biryani in the restaurant. The Balakot air strike scene comes sooner than expected. The intermission point is nail-biting. After the interval, the emotional scenes take centre stage. The Abhijeet Rathore (Ashutosh Rana) track is a masterstroke and would be loved by the moviegoers. The tragic song also contributes to the emotional quotient. The finale is totally paisa-vasool.Fighter Official Trailer | Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone, Anil Kapoor, Siddharth AnandSpeaking of performances, Hrithik Roshan is in top form. He looks extremely dashing and plays to the gallery with his action and sarcastic and massy dialogues. But he also impresses in the scenes where he has to act vulnerable. Deepika Padukone has slightly less screen time and one wishes she had more to do. Nevertheless, her character is well thought out and the makers have delivered a solid message with her track. Performance-wise, she is terrific, as expected. Anil Kapoor performs ably and also contributes to the whistles and claps in some scenes. Akshay Oberoi and Karan Singh Grover are superb and lend able support. Rishabh Ravinder Sawhney looks menacing but he should have kept his performance in check. Ashutosh Rana rocks the show in a cameo. The same goes for Sharib Hashmi (Varthaman). Sanjeeda Sheikh (Sanchi) and Talat Aziz are decent. The others who do well are the actors playing Basheer’s father, Officer Unni, Officer Harish Nautiyal aka Nauty, Naina Jaising and Neha Joshi.Vishal-Sheykhar's music doesn’t work as intended. 'Ishq Jaisa Kuch' appears in the end credits and is picturized beautifully. But the soundtrack is forgettable. 'Sher Khul Gaye' is catchy. 'Heer Aasmani' and 'Dil Banaane Waaleya' are well-woven into the narrative. 'Mitti' is the best song of the lot. 'Bekaar Dil' is missing from the film. Sanchit Balhara And Ankit Balhara's background score has a big-screen cinematic appeal.Satchith Paulose's cinematography is quite rich. Seayoung Oh, Parvez Shaikh and Sunil Rodrigues' action is not too violent and easy to understand, despite the characters fighting from the air planes. Redefine and DNEG's VFX is top-class. Rajat Poddar's production design is superior. Shaleena Nathani, Lakshmi Lehr and Niharika Jolly's costumes are appealing. Aarif Sheikh's editing could have been tighter.On the whole, FIGHTER is a paisa-vasool patriotic entertainer that ticks all the right boxes. The film rests on Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone’s terrific performances, big-screen appeal, massy action scenes and some very strong emotional moments. At the box office, the film will start slow on Day 1 but has the potential to pick up big time and emerge as a hit. 
  Main Atal Hoon Movie Review: MAIN ATAL HOON rests on Pankaj Tripathi's outstanding performance.  
 
 
 Fri, 19 Jan 2024 12:06:11 +0200 
 MAIN ATAL HOON is the story of India's respected leader. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (Pankaj Tripathi) lives in Agra with his family. In 1938, as a school kid, he is not able to recite a poem in front of his class after he forgets the lines. This is when his father (Piyush Mishra) suggests that he should try to understand the moot point of his speech instead of rote learning. This lesson plays a huge step in Atal's rise as a great orator. He soon joins the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and becomes a close associate of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (Pramod Pathak) and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (Daya Shankar Pandey). He joins a political party, Akhil Bhartiya Jana Sangh, and even becomes a Member of Parliament in 1957. Soon, things deteriorate in the country. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay die under mysterious circumstances. Atal Bihari Vajpayee decides to take things into his hands for the sake of his country.MAIN ATAL HOON is inspired by Sarang Darshane’s Book 'Atalji: Kavihridayachye Rashtranetyachi Charitkahani'. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's story (co-written by Amol Bhor and Mayuresh Bhor) is captivating and could have made for a great biopic. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's screenplay, however, fails to do justice. The writers do not delve into the episodes and briefly touch upon them before going ahead with the story. As a result, one doesn’t feel connected with the film. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's dialogues are sharp but not as impactful as intended.Ravi Jadhav's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit where it's due, he has got the technical aspects right. The film has a big-screen appeal and looks grand in every way. A few scenes stand out like Atal’s love affair with Rajkumari (Ekta Kaul), Atal’s first speech in Lok Sabha and his subsequent meeting with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (Haresh Khatri), Atal forming a bond with a schoolgirl, the Pokhran test etc.On the flipside, the makers try to show too many life episodes of the former Prime Minister. While doing so, they keep jumping from one incident to another. As a result, most of the sequences don’t impress as they are not properly explained or are depicted too quickly to get registered. In some places, the narrative is also disjointed. The makers also never explain what happened to Atal’s family, why he was all alone or how Indira Gandhi got back to power in 1980.Main Atal Hoon – Trailer | Pankaj Tripathi | Ravi Jadhav | Vinod BhanushaliSpeaking of performances, Pankaj Tripathi hits the ball out of the park. This is one of his best performances and the way he has got into the skin of his character is seen to be believed. It’s thanks to him that the film is watchable. Piyush Mishra is likeable in a cameo. Ekta Kaul leaves a mark. Pramod Pathak and Daya Shankar Pandey are decent. Raja Rameshkumar Sevak (Lal Krishna Advani) does quite well, though he’s a bit over the top in a few scenes. Payal Nair (Indira Gandhi) is okay. Prasanna Ketkar (M S Gowalkar), Ajay Purkar (Hedgewar) and Haresh Khatri leave a mark. Gauri Sukhtanker (Sushma Swaraj) tries too hard.Songs are forgettable. 'Ankahaa' is a bit memorable for its picturization. The title song, 'Desh Pehle', 'Ram Dhun' and 'Hindu Tan-Man' won’t have a shelf life. Monty Sharma's background score enhances the cinematic appeal.Lawrence DCunha's cinematography is quite good. Sandeep Ravade's production design is authentic. Sachin Lovalekar's costumes are well-researched. Bunty Nagi's editing is incoherent.On the whole, MAIN ATAL HOON rests on Pankaj Tripathi’s outstanding performance. But it suffers big time due to its flawed and disjointed narrative. At the box office, due to very limited hype, it’ll face a tough time. 
  The Beekeeper (English) Movie Review: THE BEEKEEPER fails to impress. 
 
 
 Thu, 18 Jan 2024 12:01:24 +0200 
 THE BEEKEEPER is the story of a ruthless man. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) leads a quiet life as a beekeeper. His neighbour is her kind-hearted landlord, Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher. One day, she falls for a phishing scam and is robbed of over $2 million. A majority of this money belonged to the charitable organization that she manages. She is so devastated by the turn of events that she ends her life. Adam decides to teach the scammers a lesson. He contacts the Beekeepers, a mysterious organization that he's a part of and is determined not to stop until he eliminates all the players from the bottom to the top. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Kurt Wimmer's story is clichéd. Kurt Wimmer's screenplay is arresting but since the plot is not original, it fails to overall impress. The dialogues are okay. In the absence of subtitles, it becomes difficult to decipher some of the lines.David Ayer's direction is decent. He tries his best to enhance the entertainment quotient of the film. But the biggest problem with the film is the plot and it instantly reminds one of JOHN WICK. In fact, in the scene where Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons) tells Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) that no one can save him from Adam, one can’t help but draw parallels with the Keanu Reeves starrer as it had a very similar sequence. The film stagnates in the middle and the track of the FBI agents is not convincing.Thankfully, the film has a few plusses. The scene where Adam sets the call centre on fire is sudden and fun. It also comes too quickly as one doesn’t expect him to reach his target so soon. The track of the US President gave some novel touch to the otherwise beaten-to-death storyline. The finale is watchable.Jason Statham, as expected, slips into the role effortlessly and looks quite cool while performing the action scenes. Josh Hutcherson is convincing as the villain. Jeremy Irons lends able support. Phylicia Rashad is lovely in a cameo. Emmy Raver-Lampman (FBI Agent Verona Parker) and Bobby Naderi (Agent Matt Wiley) are fair but are let down by the writing. Jemma Redgrave (President Danforth) is bland. Don Gilet (Deputy Director Prigg) and Taylor James (Lazarus; tough mercenary) are memorable.Dave Sardy and Jared Michael Fry's music is in sync with the narrative. Gabriel Beristain's cinematography is praiseworthy. Ben Munro's production design is top-class while Kelli Jones' costumes are authentic. The action is quite gory and disturbing. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing is sharp.On the whole, THE BEEKEEPER fails to impress as it’s too similar to JOHN WICK. 
  Merry Christmas Movie Review: MERRY CHRISTMAS is well made and laced with a fine performance. 
 
 
 Thu, 11 Jan 2024 21:31:37 +0200 
 MERRY CHRISTMAS is the story of two strangers and their unforgettable adventure. In the late 80s, Albert (Vijay Sethupathi) returns to his home in Bombay after several years on Christmas Eve. His mother passed away a year ago and he's devastated over the loss. He goes out to have a drink. At a restobar, he meets Maria (Katrina Kaif) and her mute daughter, Annie (Pari Maheshwari Sharma). Albert and Maria start talking and soon, Maria invites him home. She reveals that her husband Jerome (Luke Kenny) is cheating on her. Albert, meanwhile, opens up about his dead girlfriend Rosie (Radhika Apte). Maria puts Annie to sleep and goes out with Albert. When they return, they get the shock of their lives. And this is just the beginning of many twists and turns that await them.MERRY CHRISTMAS is based on the book 'Le Monte-Charge' by Frédéric Dard. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's story is unconventional and gripping. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's screenplay is captivating and after a point, doesn't let your attention wander even for a second. But the writing stretches at some parts. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's dialogues are sharp and witty, especially the ones mouthed by Vijay Sethupathi.Sriram Raghavan's direction is bravura. The filmmaker's distinct execution style and trademark stamp are visible from start to finish, be it in the film's vintage aspects, music and of course, in the twists and turns. Also, this time he gives an out-of-the-box experience as he uses the slow burn technique. As a result, nothing shocking happens until a few minutes before the intermission. Post-interval, the film goes on a high as too many amusing and thrilling developments occur. From here on, the audience will be completely on the edge of their seats. The climax is unexpected.On the flipside, the film might test the patience of the audience in the first half, especially in the first 15 minutes. Ideally, the run time should have been two hours. The ending is a bit abrupt and it might not be acceptable to some of the moviegoers. Lastly, the film has a niche appeal and is not meant for the mass audience.Speaking of performances, it’s a Vijay Sethupathi show without a shred of doubt. The actor, with his deadpan expressions and dry sense of humour, takes the cake. Only he could have pulled this role off so smoothly. Katrina Kaif also puts her best foot forward and delivers a stupendous performance. Certain scenes were challenging but she manages to deliver a convincing act. Sanjay Kapoor (Ronnie Fernandes) is entertaining. Vinay Pathak (Paresh Kamdar) is rocking, though he has limited screen time. Tinnu Anand (Albert’s uncle) and Pratima Kannan (Lakshmi; cop) leave a huge mark. Ashwini Kalsekar (Scarlett) is there for just a scene and is memorable. Pari Maheshwari Sharma is cute. Luke Kenny and Radhika Apte are fair in cameo appearances.Merry Christmas – Hindi Trailer | Vijay Sethupathi | Katrina Kaif | Sriram Raghavan | Ramesh TauraniPritam's music is well-woven into the narrative. The title track and 'Raat Akeli Thi' are the best of the lot. 'Nazar Teri' and 'Dil Ki Mez Pe' are just okay. Daniel B George's background score enhances the impact, especially in the climax.Madhu Neelakandan's cinematography is topnotch. Mayur Sharma's production design is realistic yet appealing. The same applies to Anaita Shroff Adajania and Sabina Halder's costumes. Hira Yadav and Sunil Rodrigues' action is devoid of gore and is minimal. Pooja Ladha Surti's editing could have been sharper.On the whole, MERRY CHRISTMAS is a well-made thriller and is laced with a fine performance by Vijay Sethupathi. At the box office, it’ll need a strong word of mouth to succeed as it appeals only to the multiplex audience in the urban areas. 
  Kho Gaye Hum Kahan Movie Review: KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s strength lies in its performances, memorable moments and depiction. 
 
 
 Tue, 26 Dec 2023 13:30:52 +0200 
 KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN is the story of three friends. Imaad Ali (Siddhant Chaturvedi) is a stand-up comic with a dark past. He lives in Mumbai with his close friend, Ahana Singh (Ananya Panday), an MBA graduate and a working professional. Both are best friends with Neil Pereira (Adarsh Gourav), a gym trainer. Ahana is dating Rohan Bhatia (Rohan Gurbaxani) since three years. She wants to marry him but Rohan is not ready and he decides to take a break from the relationship. A distraught Ahana tries her best to get back to Rohan. When nothing works, she decides to resort to social media. Neil is having a fling with Lala (Anya Singh), an attractive fashion influencer. Neil is serious about her but she doesn’t want the world to know that they are seeing each other. Imaad, meanwhile, is a serial dating addict with commitment issues. He meets Simran Kohli (Kalki Koechlin), who’s older than her. Yet, both connect and get serious about each other. Meanwhile, Neil dreams of owning a premium gym where he’ll train only 10 members at a time so that they can be given adequate attention which might not be available in other fitness centres. Ahana loves the idea and offers to quit her job and help him in setting up his dream project. Imaad, who’s stinking rich, agrees to invest. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Zoya Akhtar, Arjun Varain Singh and Reema Kagti's story is relatable and relevant for today’s times. Zoya Akhtar, Arjun Varain Singh and Reema Kagti's screenplay is breezy and uncomplicated. Apart from the relatable aspects, what also touches viewers is how the life of the trio has been depicted. A few moments stand out. At the same time, the writing gets too stretched. Yash Sahai's dialogues are riddled with today’s lingo and again, have a relatable quality. Sapan Verma's dialogues for stand-up comedy scenes are hilarious.Arjun Varain Singh's direction is neat. He ensures that one can connect with the goings-on, especially the urban youth. The issues, happiness, achievements etc. of the characters are a reflection of the lives many are living today. The social media angle also gives a nice touch. Arjun touches upon ghosting, the fake life of influencers, difficulties faced by people in staying away from their phones, using social media to get validation and even stalking ex-partners, bullying on social media etc. Some scenes that are well executed are Imaad and Simran’s first meet, Lala’s birthday bash, the epic showdown between Imaad and Neil etc. But it’s the song 'Ishq Nachaawe' which shows Arjun’s real strength as a storyteller. The finale is sweet.On the flipside, there are times in the film where nothing much is happening. Hence, this 134-minute-long film could have been edited by 20 minutes. The track of Neil in the end will leave the audience divided. The turn of events is difficult to digest and also how he comes out of it is not convincing. This track is also left abrupt, which is strange since all the other tracks are nicely summed up in the end credits song. Lastly, the issues and lifestyle shown in the film is too urban and a big chunk of the audience won’t be able to relate.Siddhant Chaturvedi delivers yet another commendable performance after GULLY BOY [2019] and proves why he’s an actor with immense potential. His comic timing is spot on but watch out for him in the emotional sequences. Ananya Panday, too, is a revelation with this film and perhaps, this is her best act. She performs with ease and looks natural. Adarsh Gourav is too good, as expected, and depicts the complexities of his part with utmost conviction. Kalki Koechlin is likeable and apt for the role. Anya Singh is convincing as an influencer who can go to any lengths for fame. She is a bit over the top but that was necessary. Vijay Maurya (Malcolm; Neil's father), Rahul Vohra (Aamir; Imaad's father) and Narendra Jetley (Paresh Phadnis; creepy neighbour) leave a mark. Rohan Gurbaxani, Divya Jagdale (Sally; Neil's mother), Garima Yagnik (Meher; Ahana's work colleague), Kashyap Kapoor (Melbun; Imaad's manager), Mahathi Ramesh (Aisha) and Roshmin Mehandru (Harsh; Malaika's primary trainer) are fair. Malaika Arora Khan is sizzling in a cameo.KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s soundtrack also has a niche feel, just like the film. 'Ishq Nachaawe' stands out due to the tune, singing and picturization. 'Hone Do Jo Hota Hai' and the title track come next. 'I Wanna See You Dance', 'Teri Yeh Baatein' and 'Baahon Mein Teri' are okay. Sid Shirodkar's background score is appropriate.Tanay Satam's cinematography is first-class and has a bit of a noir touch. Sally White's production design is superior. Bridget Baker's costumes are glamorous and stylish. Nitin Baid's editing could have been slicker.On the whole, KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s strength lies in its performances, memorable moments and most importantly, depiction of the reality of today's social media era. The target audience, that is the urban youth, is sure to lap up the film. 
  Salaar Movie Review: CEASEFIRE boasts of moments that will be loved by the masses. 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Dec 2023 13:46:50 +0200 
 SALAAR: PART 1 – CEASEFIRE is the story of a fearless man. The year is 2017. Aadhya (Shruti Haasan) arrives on a fake passport in India after hiding in the USA for almost 7 years. Aadhya keeps her father Krishnakant in the dark about her decision to land in Varanasi. Krishnakant’s enemies, however, get to know and they station their men outside Varanasi airport. They attempt to kidnap Adhya; on the other hand, Krishnakant asks Bilal (Mime Gopi) for help. Bilal smartly gets Adhya out of their clutches and takes her to Tinsukia, Assam. Here, he tells Deva (Prabhas) to take care of her. Prabhas’ mother (Easwari Rao), a strict headmaster of a school, has no idea about the danger to Adhya’s life. The mother employs Adhya as an English teacher in her school. Sadly, the plan is foiled as Krishnakant’s enemies find out about Adhya’s location. Meanwhile, from Kandla Port, a consignment with a prestigious seal is on its way to Burma. The men are told to go via Tinsukia and kidnap Aadhya. They do so but the truck is forced to stop as Deva attacks the team while trying to save Aadhya. However, it’s forbidden to stop the truck with the seal as it belongs to Khansaar, an autonomous, lawless territory. Vardharaja (Prithviraj Sukumaran) of Khansaar is informed about this fiasco and that his childhood friend Deva is the one who committed the ‘crime’. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Prashanth Neel's story is detailed and quite imaginative. At the same time, the mass moments are well taken care of. Prashanth Neel's screenplay is massy and entertaining. He uses the KGF template to heighten the tension and commercial moments to give the audience their money’s worth. However, there are far too many characters in Khansaar and it’s sure to confuse viewers. Dr Suri, Riya Mukherjee and Maneesh's Hindi dialogues are sharp.Prashanth Neel's direction is exemplary. To give credit where it’s due, he has riddled the film with interesting characters and a fascinating lawless world. The depiction is superb and fit for a big-screen experience. His USP is that he adds to the scene by having parallel sequences which are as tension-filled as the principal sequence. The way he switches between the two sequences while establishing a common factor between them is seen to be believed. He also smartly doesn’t let Deva attack initially so that when he does, the impact is manifold. This happens in the second half as well, where the audience will go in a frenzy.On the flipside, the biggest issue is that it’s extremely complicated. Apart from too many players in Khansaar, they have their politics and many of them are related to each other. The audience will find it difficult to get the hang of the complete picture and also the conflict. In fact, the whole ‘Ceasefire’ track is not easy to decipher. The twist in the climax is intended to amaze the audience and that doesn’t happen. Also, the pace is slow and the scenes of suffering go on and on. This formula worked well in KGF - CHAPTER 1 [2018] but here, the impact is limited.Speaking of performances, Prabhas could have done better but his performance is much better than his works in ADIPURUSH [2023], RADHE SHYAM [2022], SAAHO [2018] etc. He looks at ease in doing action and his starry screen presence is enough for the mass audience to root for him. Prithviraj Sukumaran has a late entry but rocks the show. Shruti Haasan is hardly there and is just fine. Easwari Rao leaves a mark. Mime Gopi and the actor playing Krishnkant are quite good. Jagapathi Babu (Raja Mannar), Sriya Reddy (Radha Rama Mannar), Ramachandra Raju (Rudra) and Tinnu Anand (Gaikwad) deliver fine performances. John Vijay (Ranga) hams. The actors playing Selfie, Vishnu and Bharwa are okay.Ravi Basrur's music is soulful but both the songs 'Sooraj Hi Chhaon Banke' and 'Qisson Mein' won’t have a shelf life. Ravi Basrur's background score is not too loud and works.Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is first-rate. Anbariv's action is very violent and disturbing. T L Venkatachalapathi's production design is well researched. Thota Vijay Bhaskar's costumes are stylish. Prime Focus's VFX is top-class. Ujwal Kulkarni's editing is stylish and could have been sharper as the film drags in certain places.On the whole, SALAAR: PART 1 – CEASEFIRE boasts of whistle-worthy moments that will be loved by the masses. However, the excessive violence, a needlessly complicated second half and a limited showcasing due to DUNKI will affect its box office prospects to an extent. 
  Dunki Movie Review: DUNKI bears the Rajkumar Hirani stamp of filmmaking with the right message and emotions. 
 
 
 Thu, 21 Dec 2023 13:59:21 +0200 
 DUNKI is the story of four youths trying to fly abroad for a better life. The year is 1995. Army officer Hardayal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) arrives in Laltu, Punjab to meet Mahendar, who saved his life. He reaches his house and finds out that Mahendar is no more.  Mahendar lost a golden opportunity in sports while trying to save Hardy and then passed away in an accident. Hardy takes it upon himself to help Mahendar's family. Mahendar's sister Manu (Taapsee Pannu) asks Hardy to help her with wrestling. This is because she wants to go to the UK to earn and win back her house that her father had lost due to non-payment of a loan. An agent has assured her that she can be sent on a sports visa and hence, she wants to learn the basic techniques of a sport. Hardy teaches her wrestling. However, the agent usurps money from Manu, Balli Kakkad (Anil Grover), Buggu Lakhanpal (Vikram Kochhar), and others and runs away. With no other option, Manu, Balli, and Buggu approach Geetu Gulati (Boman Irani) for help. He runs an English-speaking institute and promises to help those trying to clear their IELTS exam. The trio along with Hardy enroll in his classes. Here, they meet Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal), and all five become close friends. They aim to reach the UK by hook or by crook. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani and Kanika Dhilon's story is superb and very relatable, especially for those from the South Asian diaspora. Many people from this belt have faced issues with immigration and hence, they’ll connect with the plot. Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani, and Kanika Dhilon's screenplay is a mixed bag. While some moments are emotional and hilarious, the script overall could have been much better, especially when it's penned by Abhijat and Rajkumar. Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani and Kanika Dhilon's dialogues are witty at places but again, going by their previous work, the one-liners should have had far more punch.Rajkumar Hirani's direction is simplistic. As always, he uses his laugh-cry-drama formula successfully. Hence, the film doesn’t ever get slow or boring. There’s no dull moment. The film starts in the present day and the way the dynamics are shown, one gets curious to know what must have happened with the characters. It also gives a déjà vu of the beginning of 3 IDIOTS [2009]. The scenes where Hardy and his team try to learn English and their visa interviews are worth watching. The intermission point is quite strong. In the second half, the scenes of Hardy in the UK court and the whole Saudi Arabia sequence turn out to be the best parts of the film. The ending is moving, and the stats mentioned are quite hard-hitting and depressing. Thankfully, the final scene is funny, and the film ends on a lighter note.On the flipside, the writing is not up to the mark. The makers haven’t focused on the families and their sufferings. Viewers should feel that the characters had a strong reason to move to the UK. But this aspect was not properly touched upon. Secondly, the humorous scenes in the first half don’t bring the house down. The same applies to Manu’s fake marriage episode. And this was necessary as all previous works of Rajkumar Hirani wowed the audience. As a result, one can’t help but expect tremendously from his films. DUNKI is nowhere close to MUNNA BHAI, 3 IDIOTS, PK, etc, and hence, audiences will feel a bit dejected, despite the film’s strong points.Dunki Drop 6: Banda | Shah Rukh Khan | Rajkumar Hirani | Taapsee PannuSpeaking of performances, Shah Rukh Khan does well and brings alive the humour and emotions effectively. However, as an old man, he’s not quite convincing. Nevertheless, it’s heartening to see him shed his superstar aura and play a character role after witnessing him in massier avatars in PATHAAN and DUNKI. Taapsee Pannu is a revelation and delivers a smashing performance. She gets the nuances in the old-age scenes quite right. Vicky Kaushal rocks the show in a cameo. Anil Grover and Vikram Kochhar are lovely and lend able support. Boman Irani and Deven Bhojani (Puru Patel) are lovely. Others do well.Pritam's music is not of chartbuster variety, but the songs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Lutt Putt Gaya' comes at a fine juncture and is pleasant. 'Main Tera Rasta Dekhunga' stands out. 'Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se', 'O Maahi' and 'Banda' are in sync with the film’s theme. Aman Pant's background score is appropriate.Muraleedharan C K, Manush Nandan and Amit Roy's cinematography is breathtaking and gives the film a big-screen appeal. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is authentic. Sham Kaushal's action is limited. Eka Lakhani's costumes are realistic and non-glamorous. Rajkumar Hirani's editing is slick.On the whole, DUNKI bears the Rajkumar Hirani stamp of filmmaking with the right message and emotions as a backdrop. However, it is not as outstanding as his previous films as the writing plays spoilsport to a great extent. At the box office, it will turn out to be a mix bag. 
  Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom (English) Movie Review: AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM works due to the performances but suffers from a disappointing climax. 
 
 
 Thu, 21 Dec 2023 10:16:49 +0200 
 AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM is the story of a man teaming up with his half-brother for a greater cause. Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is married to Mera (Amber Heard) and are proud parents to a baby boy. Arthur is finding it difficult to fulfil his duties as a king. He wants Atlantis to establish contact with the surface world as the sea residents get sick due to pollution. But Lady Karshon (Indya Moore) rejects this idea. She also has reservations about Aquaman not being around half of the time. Meanwhile, David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) has teamed up with Dr Stephen Shin (Randall Park) and their expedition takes them to the farthest corner of the Earth. There, David finds a trident. The trident, belonging to an evil force, possesses David and he suddenly gets knowledge of a lot of Atlantean secrets. David takes Dr Shin and his team's help in extracting Orichalcum, a substance that fuels ancient technology but which also can cause catastrophe on the planet. While David tries to extract Orichalcum, he comes into contact with Atlantis. And all hell breaks loose. Aquaman decides to go behind David, for which he has no choice but to team up with his half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), who is imprisoned following his crimes against Atlantis. What happens next forms the rest of the film.James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Jason Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett's story is entertaining. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay has its share of fun and dramatic moments but leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are sharp and witty.James Wan's direction is simple and to the point. The director doesn’t waste time and gets straight to the point. The USP of the film is how Aquaman and Orm form a bond and it makes for a great watch. In fact, it is the best part of the film. The scene where Aquaman rescues Orm and they both cross a 'bridge' are hilarious scenes. The track of Dr Shin is also quite good, especially how he introduces himself to Aquaman and Orm.On the flipside, the climax is underwhelming. A lot of build-up is done for the villain but nothing much happens thereafter. The final flight is also quite clichéd. The family members of Aquaman are conveniently forgotten. One can understand Mera’s track being supposedly chopped off but it’s sad to see even Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) hardly being there. Lastly, the mid-credit scene is disgusting and the makers should have used their imagination better.Speaking of performances, Jason Momoa is in fine form. One can sense that he enjoys playing the superhero. Patrick Wilson is too good and it’s fun to root for his character this time. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is decent as the villain. Randall Park leaves a huge mark. Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren (Nereus) don’t have much to do. The same goes for Indya Moore.Rupert Gregson-Williams' music has a cinematic feel. Don Burgess's cinematography is breathtaking. Bill Brzeski and Sahby Mehalla's production design is world-class. Richard Sale's costumes are appealing. Action is not disturbing. VFX is great but could have been better. Kirk Morri's editing is slick.On the whole, AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM works due to Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson’s equation and performances in the film but suffers on account of a disappointing climax. At the box office, it’ll face a tough time since it’ll get sandwiched between SALAAR and DUNKI. 
  Maestro (English) Movie Review: On the whole, MAESTRO has a few shortcomings but is worth watching. 
 
 
 Wed, 20 Dec 2023 17:58:09 +0200 
 MAESTRO is the story of an American composer and his relationship with his wife. In the year 1943, Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper), 25, lives in New York City as assistant conductor to the New York Philharmonic. He gets a sudden chance to make his debut as a conductor when Bruno Walter falls ill. Leonard’s performance is well-received. This is when he has an affair with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). This relationship ends and later, he meets an aspiring actress, Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). Both date and soon get married. They have three children – Jamie (Maya Hawke), Alexander (Sam Nivola) and Nina (Alexa Swinton). As the years pass, both Leonard and Felicia become famous in their professions. Soon, cracks develop in their relationship due to Leonard’s homosexual tendencies as well as his alcohol and substance abuse. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer's story is simple and on paper, it might not have sounded like a cinematic treat. But Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer's screenplay is replete with a lot of drama and stylish narration, which makes MAESTRO a grand biopic. But the novel script leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are fine. In the scenes where Bradley is holding a cigarette in his mouth, it becomes a struggle to decipher his dialogues (Thank God for subtitles).Bradley Cooper's direction is technically supreme. A part of the film is in Black-and-White. Also, a major portion of the film is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The impact of a few shots is enhanced with the use of music. Moreover, the scene where Leonard and his team play the Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection) is in one take and is seen to be believed.On the flipside, the makers try to fit in a lot in 130 minutes and it doesn’t work as intended. The script is not up to the mark in several places. The narrative style, though novel, is such that one doesn’t get fully involved in Leonard’s life.Bradley Cooper, the director, might have faltered but Bradley Cooper the actor is flawless. This is easily his most accomplished performance and also one of the best performances in recent times. One can see that he has gone all out to ensure the performance makes an impact. Carey Mulligan, too, puts her best foot forward. Her role is a bit subtle but nevertheless, it makes an impact. Both Carey and Bradley are sure to be nominated for the Oscars. These two actors dominate the film. Hence, though Matt Bomer, Maya Hawke, Sam Nivola and Alexa Swinton do well, they are not as memorable.Leonard Bernstein's music is used in the film and it's impactful. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is stunning. Kevin Thompson's production design and Mark Bridges's costumes are authentic. Michelle Tesoro's editing is novel.On the whole, MAESTRO has a few shortcomings but is worth watching for Bradley Cooper’s award-worthy performance. 
  Kadak Singh Movie Review: Despite the performances, KADAK SINGH has a complicated and disappointing second half.  
 
 
 Fri, 08 Dec 2023 11:04:51 +0200 
 KADAK SINGH is the story of a father and daughter. Arun K Srivastava (Pankaj Tripathi) works at the Department of Financial Crime (DFC), Kolkata and is very good at his job. His home environment, however, is not healthy. His wife Mimi (Khushboo Kamal) died some years ago. He single-handedly raised his children, Sakshi (Sanjana Sanghi) and Aditya (Varun Buddhadev). There has been a breakdown of communication between the father and the children. Arun usually gets angry with them, prompting Sakshi and Aditya to address their father as ‘Kadak Singh’. At DFC, Arun is working on the high-profile Golden Sun Chit Fund case. A man called Ashok Agarwal (Sanjeev Sharma) duped thousands of people of their hard-earned money and has gone into hiding. Acting on a tip-off, Arun goes to a shady hotel to catch Ashok. To ensure that no one gets suspicious, he and his female colleague head to the hotel as a couple in love. There, he bumps into Sakshi who has come there to pay off a cop who’s harassing Aditya after the latter was caught with drugs. Arun is devastated as he sees Sakshi with a male friend and assumes that he is her partner. Sakshi, meanwhile, is shocked to see her father in such a hotel with a woman and blasts him in the middle of the road. The same evening, Arun allegedly tries to end his life, presumably due to humiliation. He survives but loses his memory. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Viraf Sarkari, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, and Ritesh Shah's story is compelling. Ritesh Shah's screenplay doesn’t do justice to the promising plot in hand. All characters don’t get the required screen time and also, the narrative gets complicated. Ritesh Shah's dialogues, however, are witty and even raise laughs.Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit where it's due, he has fleshed out the characters and their equation with one another in a neat and entertaining manner. This is especially with regards to Arun’s bond with Sakshi and Arun’s bond with the nurse, Miss Kanan (Parvathy Thiruvothu). The patient-nurse bond shown in this film is a first of its kind. The first half is intriguing as weightage is given not just to the father-daughter equation but also to the scam. All is going fine until Naina’s (Jaya Ahsan) flashback.From here on, the film goes downhill as the focus shifts to the scam which is not as exciting. The daughter’s track is more or less forgotten, and this is not done since viewers have invested so much time in this character. Also, the goings-on are a bit difficult to comprehend. The makers try to infuse tension here with the scene where Sanjana goes into the shop with several mannequins. However, it looks forced. The finale is unexpected but doesn’t work as intended.The performances, however, are of a tall order and their standalone scenes are memorable. Pankaj Tripathi hits the ball out of the park with his performance which leaves viewers amused as well as moved. It’s a role in his zone and yet, he tries to make it stand out from the rest of his acts. Sanjana Sanghi is superb and shows that she has grown as an actor. It’s sad that she is hardly there in the second half. Parvathy Thiruvothu is highly entertaining and adds a lot to the film with her performance. Paresh Pahuja (Arjun) gives a sincere performance. Varun Buddhadev is dependable. Jaya Ahsan leaves a huge mark. Dilip Shankar (Tyagi; boss) and Rajan Modi (Subhash; Arun’s colleague) are fair.Shantanu Moitra's music is forgettable. Both 'Tu Jo Hai' and 'Ae Mere Dil' are relegated to the background. Shantanu Moitra's background score adds to the intrigue factor.Avik Mukhopadhyay's cinematography is lovely. The locales of Kolkata are captured in a beautiful manner. Natasha Gauba's production design is authentic. Vineet Chauhan's costumes for Pankaj Tripathi and Bidisha Kohli's costumes for the rest of the actors are realistic. Arghyakamal Mitra's editing is decent.On the whole, KADAK SINGH has a complicated and disappointing second half. The performances are the saving grace of this film. 
  Wonka (English) Movie Review: On the whole, WONKA is a sweet, 'delicious' entertainer. 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Dec 2023 17:27:43 +0200 
 WONKA is the story of an adorable chocolatier. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives in a big city to fulfil his dream of opening a chocolate shop in a plaza named Galleries Gourmet. He is poor and on the first day, all his sovereigns get used up. Willy is all set to sleep on a bench out in the open in the biting cold weather. Bleacher (Tom Davis) pretends to take pity on him and takes him to the residence of Mrs Scrubbit (Olivia Colman). She offers a room in her lodge for one sovereign a night. She even allows him to pay her the next day and asks him to sign a contract. Noodle (Calah Lane), a young girl who works at Scrubbit's property, warns him to "read the fine print". Wonka can't read and he signs the contract anyway. The next day, he arrives at the Galleries Gourmet and displays his magical chocolates to the curious onlookers. In no time, they buy his sweets, earning the wrath of the 'Chocolate cartel' run by Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Fickelgrube (Mathew Baynton). They fear that he'll eat into their chocolate business and bribe the chief police officer (Keegan-Michael Key) to oust him from town. If that is not enough, Wonka gets a shock when he arrives back at Scrubbit's place and she tells him that as per the contract he signed, he owes her 10,000 sovereigns! Wonka is unable to pay and hence, he's forced to do laundry for the next 27 years until he can pay off his debt. In the laundry room, he meets an accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), a plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), an ex-telephone exchange staffer Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and a stand-up comic Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Just like Wonka, they also stayed at Scrubbit's place and signed the contract without reading the finer details. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The characters in WONKA are based on the ones created by Roald Dahl but Paul King's story is original and imaginative. Simon Farnaby and Paul King's screenplay is entertaining and riddled with some fascinating and funny sequences that will appeal to kids and families. The dialogues add to the fun.Paul King's direction is easy to comprehend. He has given the film a Disney-style treatment and hence, there's a lot of music, scary and yet funny antagonists, touching scenes and of course, fantasy. A few scenes stand out like Noodles having chocolate for the first time. The scene at the zoo is moving and also very cute. The climax is lovely.On the flipside, the interest drops in the middle portions. Also, it is understandable that a film like this will have cinematic liberties. Yet, to see Wonka doing so much magic is difficult to digest. He could have actually pulled himself out of poverty and misery, considering what he was able to achieve with his magic tricks!Speaking of performances, Timothée Chalamet is simply charming. He handles the part with ease and ensures no one compares him with Johnny Depp, whose Wonka act in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY [2005] is legendary. Calah Lane is sweet and an actor to watch out for. Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are too good, especially when they begin their love affair. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton are fine as the villains. Keegan-Michael Key, Jim Carter, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar and Rich Fulcher lend able support. Rowan Atkinson (Father Julius) and Hugh Grant (Oompa-Loopma) add to the star value with their cameos.Joby Talbot and Neil Hannon's music is well-woven into the narrative. A few songs that are memorable are 'Have You Got A Sweet Tooth' and 'For A Moment'. Chung-hoon Chung's cinematography is splendid. Nathan Crowley's production design and Lindy Hemming's costumes are in sync with the film's fantasy theme. Mark Everson's editing is neat.On the whole, WONKA is a sweet, 'delicious' entertainer that will appeal to kids and families in metropolitan cities. 
  The Archies Movie Review: THE ARCHIES is a fine entertainer that will get whopping viewership 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:27:43 +0200 
 THE ARCHIES is the story of seven friends. The year is 1964. Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda), Betty Cooper (Khushi Kapoor), Veronica Lodge (Suhana Khan), Reggie Mantle (Vedang Raina), Jughead Jones (Mihir Ahuja), Ethel Muggs (Aditi Saigal aka Dot.) and Dilton Doiley (Yuvraj Menda) are 17-year-old kids who reside in a picturesque town in North India called Riverdale, populated by Anglo Indians. They are extremely connected with each other and with the park in Riverdale, called Green Park. Meanwhile, Hiram Lodge (Alyy Khan) plans to demolish the shops on a crucial stretch in Riverdale and convert it into a plaza. Hal’s (Satyajit Sharma) bookshop, run by Betty’s father, has to shut down, as a result. If that is not enough, then Hiram plans to cut down trees in Green Park and convert the green lung into a luxury hotel. Hiram gets Dawson (Vinay Pathak), the Town Council chief, on his side and asks him to pass the order for the hotel. Hiram, however, ensures that his name doesn’t crop up. The seven friends, meanwhile, are finding it difficult to grapple with the changes happening in their beautiful town. They are also facing struggles among themselves. Archie is confused whether he’s in love with Betty or Veronica. He also wants to move to London for higher studies, much to the annoyance of his father Fred (Suhaas Ahuja). Reggie wants to be a comedian and contribute to the newspaper, run by his father Ricky Mantle (Luke Kenny). Ricky, however, refuses as he believes in serious journalism. Dilton is hiding a deep, dark secret while Ethel’s ambition comes in the way of her interpersonal relationships. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar's story is very promising. Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar's screenplay is decent. It keeps one engaged in the goings-on. But one wishes the film had more funny and emotional scenes. Farhan Akhtar's dialogues are conversational while the one-liners of Veronica are witty. The one-liners, interestingly, don’t seem to belong to the 60s era but that’s fine.Zoya Akhtar's direction is uncomplicated. She deserves kudos as she has created a fictional world like never before and done justice to it. In no time, one gets sucked into Riverdale and even understand the landmark spots of the town. It’s fascinating to see the lives of teenagers in such a manner as it rarely happens in a Hindi film. A few of their dilemmas are well depicted. Two scenes that stand out are the date of Archie and Betty and Betty and Veronica confessing the truth and the scene thereafter. The political angle is well infused and parallels can also be drawn to the present-day happenings. The ending is predictable though the makers have tried to add a little nail-biting twist.On the flipside, the film never gives a ‘Wow’ feeling, that one expects in a Zoya Akhtar film. A few of the conflicts are superficial and even convenient. There are far too many songs. Lastly, the performances of the debutants are good but not out of the world.Agastya Nanda makes a sincere attempt. He definitely has the potential but in THE ARCHIES, he was a bit raw in a few scenes. The same applies to Suhana Khan. But she deserves kudos for convincingly pulling off the role of the spoiled brat. Khushi Kapoor’s character is restrained and she tries her best to do justice. Vedang Raina looks dashing and is fair. Mihir Ahuja is the one who raises maximum laughs. Dot is alright and suffers from limited screen time. Yuvraj Menda is lovely and the way he says ‘Thank You’ might get picked up. Speaking of the supporting cast, Alyy Khan, Satyajit Sharma and Vinay Pathak leave a tremendous mark followed by Luke Kenny and Suhaas Ahuja. James Alter (Mike Gomes; council member) and Puja Sarup (Mrs Otters; council member) are damn good in small roles. Tara Sharma (Mary Andrews), Koel Purie (Alice Cooper), Delnaaz Irani (Pam) and Sheena Khalid (new salon owner) are wasted.The Archies | Zoya Akhtar | Official Trailer | 7th December | Netflix IndiaTHE ARCHIES has too many songs and the ones that leave the maximum impact are ‘Sunoh’ and 'Yeh Saari Aawazein'. The latter comes at a crucial juncture and has soulful lyrics (Javed Akhtar). 'Everything Is Politics' is a surprise. 'Dhishoom Dhishoom' and 'Va Va Voom' are based on fascinating ideas and are superbly choreographed. 'Jab Tum Na Thee' and 'In Raahon Mein' are okay. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and Jim Satya's background score is in sync with the film's mood and zone.Nikos Andritsakis' cinematography is as breathtaking as the locales shown in the film. Suzanne Caplan Merwanji's production design is award-winning. The sets are fascinating and yet very much seem believable. Poornamrita Singh's costumes are fashionable and can become a rage. Philm CGI, Netfx Mumbai and Cinegence VFX's VFX is top-class. Nitin Baid's editing is slick.On the whole, THE ARCHIES is a fine entertainer that will get a whopping viewership on Netflix due to the fascinating setting, kids-friendly and family-friendly theme, style, music, message and above all, the excitement of watching the debut of the most talked about star kids in recent times. 
  Animal Movie Review: ANIMAL is a powerful film that rests on Ranbir Kapoor’s outstanding performance, clap worthy massy scenes. 
 
 
 Fri, 01 Dec 2023 16:29:08 +0200 
 ANIMAL is the story of an obsessed son. Ranvijay (Ranbir Kapoor) is the son of Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), who heads the successful Swastik Steel company. Ranvijay resides in a palatial mansion in Delhi with Balbir, his mother Jyoti (Charu Shankar), sisters Reet (Saloni Batra) and Roop (Anshul Chauhan). Ranvijay crazily loves Balbir. But Balbir doesn’t reciprocate as he’s too busy with work. Both also get into fights and after one such showdown, Balbir sends Ranvijay away for studies. Ranvijay returns and attends the engagement of his school classmate, Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna). He always had feelings for her and he confesses it in such a way that Geetanjali falls for him. She breaks her engagement. Meanwhile, on Balbir’s 60th birthday, Ranvijay fights with Varun (Siddhant Karnick), Reet’s husband. One thing leads to another and Ranvijay is kicked out. He marries Geetanjali and moves to the US. 8 years later, he returns when Balbir gets shot by unidentified assailants. Varun tries to act pricey but Ranvijay takes charge. He makes it his life mission to find out who tried killing the man whom he has worshipped since birth. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's story is simple. Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Pranay Reddy Vanga and Suresh Bandaru's screenplay, however, packs in a lot. There are several sub-plots and characters and riveting moments that give an audience an experience of a wholesome entertainer. However, there are cracks in the second half in the writing. Saurabh Gupta's dialogues are out-of-the-box and some of the one-liners are shocking.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's direction is stylish and massy. He peppers the film with enough dramatic and action scenes to keep the interest going. Though the film is 3 hours and 23 minutes long, one doesn’t get bored at all. The father-son and the husband-wife tracks stand out and are the most memorable, when it comes to the emotional aspect. As for the massy aspect, the scene where Ranvijay teaches college bullies a lesson will be greeted with whistles. The entire episode 30 minutes before the interval takes the impact to dizzying heights. Right from Ranvijay heading to Punjab to get his cousins on board to the much-talked-about 18-minute long interval block, the impact is seen to be believed. There will be a frenzy in cinemas, especially in the Northern belt. Also, ANIMAL is a real Pan-India film as there’s also a Maharashtrian connection which will appeal to audiences in the Western state.Sadly, after an out-of-the-world first half, ANIMAL drops slightly in the second half. The massy stuff, which is present in the first half in ample doses, is absent post-interval. Also, some of the scenes between the husband and wife may not be appreciated by a section of the female audience. Lastly, the runtime could have been shorter.Animal (Offical Trailer): Ranbir Kapoor | Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor, Bobby DeolSpeaking of performances, Ranbir Kapoor shines. The way he gets into the skin of his character is seen to be believed. The supreme actor has given several outstanding performances in the past but in ANIMAL, hands down, is his best performance till date. Anil Kapoor has fewer dialogues, but he also rocks the show. His expressions are bang-on and speaks a lot. The scenes where he raises his voice are arresting. Rashmika Mandanna is quite good and leaves a mark in certain scenes, especially in the second half. Bobby Deol (Abrar) looks dashing and in form. Sadly, his screen time is very limited. Siddhant Karnick is memorable in a small role. Charu Shankar and Saloni Batra are decent. Anshul Chauhan doesn’t get much scope. Triptii Dimri (Zoya) puts in a sincere act. Suresh Oberoi (Dadaji) and Prem Chopra (Bade Daarji) have nothing much to do. The same goes for Shakti Kapoor (Mishra). Upendra Limaye (Freddy) is thoroughly entertaining in a special appearance. Bablu Prithviraj (Asrar Haque) and Saurabh Sachdeva (Abid Haque) are fair. The actors playing Ranvijay's cousins do well.ANIMAL's soundtrack is quite good. 'Arjun Vailly' is the best song of the lot and also the most impactful. 'Hua Main' and 'Satranga' are well-shot. 'Pehle Bhi Main' and 'Papa Meri Jaan' are touching. Harshvardhan Rameshwar's background score adds to the tension and mass appeal.Amit Roy's cinematography is cinematic. Suresh Selvarajan's production design is rich. Sheetal Iqbal Sharma's costumes are in sync with the status of the characters. Supreme Sundar's action is very violent and disturbing. Do It Creative Ltd, NY VFXWaala, Visual Birds Studio, Famous Studio, and Red Chillies.VFX's VFX is first-class. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's editing is appropriate, but a few scenes could have been done away with.On the whole, ANIMAL is a powerful film that rests on Ranbir Kapoor’s outstanding performance, clap-worthy massy scenes, and an interval block that is simply out of the world. At the box office, the tremendous hype and curiosity will lead to a fantabulous opening, and it will emerge as a Blockbuster at the ticket windows. 
  Sam Bahadur Movie Review: SAM BAHADUR is a well intentioned biopic.  
 
 
 Fri, 01 Dec 2023 14:19:40 +0200 
 SAM BAHADUR is the story of India’s greatest soldier. The year is 1933. Sam Manekshaw (Vicky Kaushal) is posted in Mussoorie as a corporal in the British Indian Army. He comes across Silloo (Sanya Malhotra). Both fall in love and get married. Sam soon rises in the Army ranks thanks to his valour and no-nonsense approach. During World War II, he is posted in Burma where he fights the Japanese troops bravely. He gets shot 7 times and yet survives. During the partition, he gets an offer to join the Pakistani Army but he insists on being a part of the Indian Army. After independence, he continues to serve the army and is soon posted in Wellington, Tamil Nadu as Major General. A few years later, the Indo-China dispute erupts and this is when he comes across the future Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (Fatima Sana Shaikh). What happens next forms the rest of the film.Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's story is worthy as the life of Sam Manekshaw is truly fascinating. Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's screenplay, however, doesn’t do complete justice. A film of this kind should have numerous high points which SAM BAHADUR sadly lacks. Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's dialogues thankfully add to the drama and humour.Meghna Gulzar's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, she makes a sincere attempt to tell the story of Sam Manekshaw. She doesn’t attempt to add unnecessary drama, action or dialoguebaazi for the heck of it. Everything in the film is there for a reason and it gives one a feeling that the director is serious about doing justice to his life story. Sam’s sense of humour was famous and this aspect is well taken care of. A few scenes are memorable like Sam’s brutal injury in Burma, Sam accused of being an anti-national and Sam’s bond with Yahya Khan (Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub). The manner in which Sam manages to fly the plane from Srinagar despite no lights is the best scene of the film.On the flipside, the director should have added some sort of cinematic high, without compromising on other aspects. SAM BAHADUR is the biopic of an army man who has achieved so much. His life events have been dramatic and so much could have been done. Sadly, Meghna Gulzar, in the second half, chooses to simply document his life episodes without adding any cinematic value. This is pretty evident in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, which serves as the climax. It fails to give goosebumps as the audience will not realize the achievements of Sam in this battle, thanks to the execution.Sam Bahadur – Official Trailer | Vicky Kaushal | Meghna GulzarVicky Kaushal, however, doesn’t give any reason to complain. The actor gets into the skin of the character like never before and delivers the finest performance of his career. It’s also praiseworthy how he has worked on his body language and accent as well. Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh, too, deliver fine performances. But they don’t have much to do. Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub is decent initially and looks unrecognizable and unconvincing in the second half. He’s wasted in the climax. Neeraj Kabi (Jawaharlal Nehru) is fine. Govind Namdev (Sardar Patel) is great but sadly, he's there for just a scene. Shreas Pardiwala (Behruz) and the actors playing Swami, Dippy and others are fair.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is forgettable. Both 'Badhte Chalo' and 'Banda' don't have a shelf life. 'Itni Si Baat', however, is well picturized. Ketan Sodha's background score uplifts the impact to some extent.Jay I Patel's cinematography is neat. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is detailed. Sachin Lovelekar, Divvya Gambhir and Nidhhi Gambhir's costumes are straight out of the bygone era. Parvez Shaikh's action makes its presence felt and isn’t disturbing. Nitin Baid's editing could have been sharper.On the whole, SAM BAHADUR is a well-intentioned biopic and showcases Vicky Kaushal like never before. But it suffers due to the docudrama treatment. At the box office, the mighty opposition in the form of ANIMAL will affect its prospects to a great extent. 
  Napoleon (English) Movie Review: NAPOLEON rests on fine performances and spectacular battle scenes. 
 
 
 Fri, 24 Nov 2023 11:00:25 +0200 
 NAPOLEON is the story of the rise and fall of one of the greatest kings in history. Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) rises to fame after the French Revolution of 1789. In September 1793, he successfully lays siege in Toulon and defeats the British. The battle gives him a lot of recognition and he's promoted from the post of colonel to brigadier general. He soon falls in love with Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby) and has a tumultuous relationship with her. In 1798, he proceeds to Egypt to further undermine the British and their trade interests in Asia. He cuts short his trip when he learns that Joséphine is having an affair with Hippolyte Charles (Jannis Niewöhner). This is seen as an act of desertion but Napoleon saves himself smartly. Later on, he, Sieyes (Julian Rhind-Tutt) and Roger Ducos (Benedict Martin) plan a coup. One thing leads to another and he becomes the king of France. He continues to rise with his tactical battle strategies but also commits certain mistakes on the way. What happens next forms the rest of the film.David Scarpa's story is brilliant. The roller-coaster life of Napoleon Bonaparte is fit for a cinematic adaptation. David Scarpa's screenplay is interesting, but only in parts. The lack of a simple explanation goes heavily against the film. The dialogues are appropriate.Ridley Scott's direction is cinematic. He has a certain style and finesse and that is surely evident in several scenes. He depicts Napoleon Bonaparte with all his glory and flaws and that makes him human and closer to reality. He wows the audience in the battle scenes and certain dramatic scenes like Napoleon confronting Joséphine after learning that she cheated on him, Napoleon running to save his life after attempting a coup, Napoleon’s mother proving who is infertile among the couple, Napoleon wittily convincing the fifth regiment to switch sides, etc. As for the action scenes, the opening sequence and the Battle of Austerlitz take the cake.On the flipside, several scenes stand out when seen individually. As part of the film, it doesn’t make the desired impact as the makers skip several episodes of his life. It seems like the makers expect the viewers to know Napoleon’s life story before they catch the film. Since that’s obviously not possible, one might not be able to fully comprehend the goings-on or change in the equation between the characters. The track that is easy to comprehend is that of Napoleon and Joséphine. But the bond they share is crazy and might put off people. Lastly, it’s a niche film and not meant for mainstream audiences.Speaking of performances, Joaquin Phoenix once again hits the ball out of the park. He depicts his valour and vulnerability with utmost conviction. Vanessa Kirby, too, puts her best foot forward and seems at ease in essaying the challenging role. Edouard Philipponnat (Tsar of Russia) looks dashing and does well. The other actors like Jannis Niewöhner, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Benedict Martin, Sam Troughton (Robespierre), Paul Rhys (Talleyrand), Anna Mawn (The Duchess Marie-Louise) etc perform ably but get overshadowed by Joaquin and Vanessa. Catherine Walker (Marie-Antoinette), however, leaves a huge mark in a cameo.Martin Phipps's music tries to enhance the impact in several scenes. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is top-class. Arthur Max's production design and David Crossman and Janty Yates' costumes are well-researched. Action is brutal and not for the faint-hearted. VFX is top-class. Claire Simpson and Sam Restivo's editing is weak. The 160-minute long film should have been shorter by 10-15 minutes.On the whole, NAPOLEON rests on fine performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby and spectacular battle scenes. However, the long length, lack of simplistic narrative and niche appeal will restrict its box office collections. 
  Farrey Movie Review: FARREY is a well made and well intentioned film laced with fine performances. 
 
 
 Fri, 24 Nov 2023 09:00:13 +0200 
 FARREY is the story of a group of students trying to cheat the system. Niyati (Alizeh) is an orphan who is raised by a kind-hearted warden (Ronit Roy) at his orphanage, Ishrat Kada, in Delhi. Niyati is very intelligent and she emerges as a topper in her exams. She even gets admission to the prestigious Winston International School. The principal, Vedita Mathew (Shilpa Shukla), agrees to bear her transport and other costs, knowing her financial condition. Niyati joins the school along with Akash (Sahil Mehta), who also comes from an impoverished background and like her, is very intelligent. Niyati becomes friends with her rich classmates, Chavi (Prasanna Bisht), Prateek (Zeyn Shaw), Sahil (Arshvir Wahi) and Rishabh (Paras Nagpal). Chavi reveals to her that her father (Arbaaz Khan) has asked her to get good marks so that she gets admission to Stanford. However, Chavi is a weak student. For the mid-term exams, Niyati helps Chavi by giving her the answers written on an eraser. Chavi asks Niyati to help her again, for the next set of papers, and this time she’s ready to pay a huge amount. Niyati, at first, refuses due to the risk. Meanwhile, Vedita informs Niyati that the latter has a chance to bag a scholarship at Oxford. Niyati also learns that the warden, who is like her father, is struggling to run the orphanage. Hence, she agrees to help Chavi and her friends and even devises a smart way to cheat. All is going well until Niyati gets caught. What happens next forms the rest of the film.FARREY is an official remake of the 2017 Thai film BAD GENIUS (Directed by Nattawut Poonpiriya). The story is fresh and relatable. Soumendra Padhi and Abhishek Yadav's screenplay is tight. Not many films have been made on this topic. Hence, one looks forward to what happens next. The ending, however, is shaky. Soumendra Padhi and Abhishek Yadav's dialogues are conversational.Soumendra Padhi's direction is classy. This is not a conventional film. But he has executed certain scenes with style and it adds to the film's appeal. The scenes where the characters are copying are nail-biting. The Australia sequence, meanwhile, is intriguing.On the flipside, the ending is sweet but there's a shift in the tonality. One expects the film to continue being thrilling and maybe even get violent. But the opposite happens, and it doesn't gel well with the overall tone of the film. Secondly, while the director tries his best to explain the complexities, in some places, he fails to do so. This will leave viewers confused. Moreover, the voice record scene is a bit misleading as well. Lastly, the title is not quite simple and appears confusing.Alizeh delivers a smashing performance. It’s difficult to believe this is her debut film as she performs exactly as per the character's demand. Prasanna Bisht shines and rocks the show, especially in the second half. Sahil Mehta is decent initially but makes his presence felt in the second half. Zeyn Shaw is decent. Ronit Roy is dependable as always. Juhi Babbar Soni (Zoya) and Shilpa Shukla leave a mark. Arshvir Wahi, Paras Nagpal, Bhavna Choudhary (Priyanka) and Shivangi Negi (Monica) are okay and don't have much to do. Arbaaz Khan is fair in a cameo.Farrey Official Trailer | Salman Khan | Alizeh Agnihotri | Soumendra PadhiSachin-Jigar's music is not of the chartbuster variety. 'Ghar Pe Party Hai' and 'Machade Tabahi' are peppy while 'O Bandeya' is intended to be soulful. But these songs are not memorable. Sidhant Mathur's background score is gripping.Keiko Nakahara's cinematography is unusual. Susheel Mishra's production design is very rich, especially in the scenes set in Chavi's mansion. Natascha Charak and Nikita Mohanty's costumes are in sync with the characters and their class. Paramjeet Pamma's action is minimal and realistic. Zubin Sheikh's editing is slick.On the whole, FARREY is a well-made and well-intentioned film and is laced with fine performances by the debutants. At the box office, the confusing title, the lack of promotions and awareness is likely to impact the footfalls and the collections. The film will need a strong word of mouth to attract the audience. 
  Khichdi 2 Movie Review: On the whole, KHICHDI 2 suffers from a weak second half 
 
 
 Fri, 17 Nov 2023 14:11:24 +0200 
 KHICHDI 2 is the story of a madcap family on a dangerous mission. Kushal (Anant Vidhaat) of TIA (Thodi Intelligent Agency) meets Hansa (Supriya Pathak), Himanshu (J D Majethia), Praful (Rajeev Mehta), Jayshree (Vandana Pathak) and Babuji (Anang Desai) and asks them for help. He wants them to go to a country called Paanthukistan. The ruler of Paanthukistan, Imam Kha Ke Thuk (Rajeev Mehta), looks like Praful. Hence, the plan is that Hansa, Himanshu, Jayshree and Babuji should enter Paanthukistan pretending to be documentary filmmakers. Praful will be kept hidden in a box. When the time is right, Himanshu will feed a spiked meal to Imam Kha Ke Thuk. The king will faint and Praful will masquerade as the ruler. Kushal then wants them to find a scientist, Makhanwala (Paresh Ganatra), who has designed a dangerous robot. TIA doesn't want the robot to fall into the hands of the king as he can use it for frightening consequences. The plan is simple, but the Parekh family is well...Parekh family. Training them for this mission is a mission in itself. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Aatish Kapadia's story is superb, though it gives a déjà vu of TERE BIN LADEN [2010] and THE INTERVIEW [2014]. Aatish Kapadia's screenplay (additional screenplay by Sourav Ghosh) is weak, though some moments are quite hilarious and well thought out. Aatish Kapadia's dialogues are one of the highlights of the film. In fact, it’s the dialogues that is the saving grace.Aatish Kapadia's direction is okay. He keeps the direction simple and uncomplicated. The run time is just 121 minutes, and the film doesn’t bore even for a moment. He smartly starts the film with the helicopter sequence and then goes on a flashback. It sets the mood instantly.On the flipside, the second half is weak. With a plot like this, the film could have gone anywhere. But the writers and director let go of the opportunity. They rely solely on dialogues and gags to infuse entertainment instead of adding some physical comedy. After all, this is a film, and they should have tried to add some cinematic value. A few jokes are funny but don’t get registered. For example, the name of the British official in the 1947 sequence is Lord Mittibartan, but the audience won’t notice it properly. A crucial character is wasted, and the death of another character is unimaginative and needlessly violent for a film of this sort.Speaking of performances, Supriya Pathak takes the cake as she gets to mouth the maximum jokes. Rajeev Mehta plays both the roles with ease. J D Majethia and Vandana Pathak add to the fun and entertainment convincingly. Anang Desai is adorable. Kirti Kulhari (Parminder) is wasted. She should have been there in the climax, ideally. Anant Vidhaat lends able support. Paresh Ganatra doesn’t get much scope. Kiku Sharda is entertaining as the robot. Reyaansh Vir Chaddha (Wazir) is okay while Flora Saini (Rani Gulkanda) is over the top. Farah Khan and Pratik Gandhi are fair.Chirantan Bhatt's music is poor. 'Vande Raka' has bizarre lyrics but is shot well. 'Naach Naach' is well woven into the film. The Paanthukistan national anthem is funny. Raju Singh's background score is in sync with the film’s tone. Vijay Soni's cinematography is appropriate. Jayant Deshmukh's production design is theatrical. Falguni Trivedi's costumes are as per the character’s traits. Raj Shinde's action works. Crazy VFX's VFX is very poor. Aajay A Kumar's editing is fine.On the whole, KHICHDI 2 suffers from a weak second half and an unimaginative script. At the box office, it might surprise if the target audience accepts the film. 
  The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes (English) Movie Review: On the whole, THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES is an entertaining flick 
 
 
 Thu, 16 Nov 2023 17:19:17 +0200 
 THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES is the story of a bond shared by a mentor with his tribute in times of despair. The film is set 64 years before the events of the first film in the series. 18-year-old Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) lives in the capital city of Panem. He belongs to the Snow family which was once quite powerful but suffered immensely in the War. To win back the prestige of his family, he studies hard and comes out with flying colours. As a result, he's chosen to mentor a tribute (a participant) in the 10th edition of The Hunger Games. He is assigned the District 12 female tribute, Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She catches attention with her singing skills. When she reaches the capital city, Coriolanus goes to meet her in the Capital Zoo, where all the players are kept. The footage is shown on television and it earns the sympathy of the residents. Dr Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the head gamemaker, is upset with Coriolanus's behaviour. But Coriolanus explains that the games are not getting good viewership as viewers don't feel connected to the players. He gives ideas to increase the viewership, which gets accepted. Meanwhile, Coriolanus forms a bond with Lucy and both get quite close. The games finally begin and Coriolanus tries his best to help Lucy win, by hook or by crook. Unknown to all, Coriolanus has a hidden agenda. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The film is based on the novel ‘The Ballad Of Songbirds and Snakes’ by Suzanne Collins. The story is gripping and imaginative. Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt's screenplay is effective but gets too lengthy after a point. The dialogues are normal. The absence of English subtitles makes it a bit difficult in some scenes.Francis Lawrence's direction is neat. He keeps the storytelling simple and introduces the characters and the setting effectively. The previous two parts of the series had faced criticism and the director seems to have corrected those minuses. A few scenes stand out like Lucy’s entry, Coriolanus and Lucy bonding in the zoo at night, Lucy being sent water bottles to save herself, etc. The finale of the games is very memorable. In fact, the nail-biting moments are aplenty in the film.On the flipside, the run time of 157 minutes is way too much. Secondly, moviegoers might feel a bit cheated since The Hunger Games episode ends an hour before the end credits roll. The third act has its share of moments but it’s not something viewers have signed up for. Also, it is not as thrilling as the second act.THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES belongs to Rachel Zegler. The actress has been getting better with each film. She performs the difficult role with élan and perfection. Tom Blyth gets a bit overshadowed by Rachel but delivers a solid performance. Viola Davis is needlessly loud, although her act is watchable. Peter Dinklage (Casca Highbottom) leaves a mark, as expected. Jason Schwartzman (Lucretius Flickerman; television host) is entertaining. Josh Andrés Rivera (Sejanus Plinth) is okay. Hunter Schafer (Tigris Snow) and Fionnula Flanagan (Grandmother) don't get much scope. Nick Benson (Jessup; male tribute from 12th district) and Mackenzie Lansing (Coral; who is determined to finish Lucy in the games) make their presence felt.James Newton Howard's music has a cinematic feel. Jo Willems' cinematography is spectacular, especially in the games arena and climax. Uli Hanisch's production design is very appealing. Trish Summerville's costumes are stylish. The action is not too gory. VFX is top-class. Mark Yoshikawa's editing is weak. The film should have been shorter by at least 15 minutes.On the whole, THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES is an entertaining flick and will be loved by the fans of the series. But the lack of promotion, competition from TIGER 3 and the crucial World Cup final match on Sunday will eat into its business. 
  Apurva Movie Review: On the whole, APURVA is a well-made gripping thriller 
 
 
 Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:02:03 +0200 
 APURVA is the story of a girl in difficult circumstances. In Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, Jugnu (Rajpal Yadav), Sukha (Abhishek Banerjee), Balli (Sumit Gulati) and Chota (Aaditya Gupta) are highway thieves. They get a tip that a truck is carrying important goods that can fetch them good money. They start heading to their destination when suddenly, a tourist bus refuses to give them way. An angry Jugnu, who is behind the wheel, overtakes the bus and stops his car in front of it. He and the gang member kill the bus driver and the cleaner and begin looting the passengers. One of the passengers is Apurva (Tara Sutaria), a Gwalior-based girl who’s on her way to meet her fiancé, Siddharth (Dhairya Karwa). She hides her phone from the thieves. But Sukha spots the phone. At that moment, Siddharth calls her. Sukha picks up the phone and insults Siddharth. Siddharth hits back. Sukha gets enraged and kidnaps Apurva. They take her to a secluded place with the idea of raping her and then finishing her off. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's story is clichéd. But Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's screenplay is gripping. Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's dialogues are raw. Since it’s a realistic film, there are barely any punchy dialogues.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's direction is neat. He keeps the duration at check (100 minutes) and also the focus is on the principal track mainly. He makes good use of the arid landscape and peppers the film with a lot of nail-biting moments. The film gets better once Apurva decides to fight back. The scene involving the well is clap-worthy.On the flipside, the film is okay in the initial portions until Apurva’s entry. A film like this needs to show violence and disturbing visuals, so that the viewers cheer for the protagonist when she succeeds. Yet, a few shots are crude and needlessly added. The ending is a bit underwhelming. Also, the film gives a déjà vu of films like NH 10 [2015].Tara Sutaria delivers the best performance of her career and looks convincing as a girl fighting off dangerous goons. Rajpal Yadav is quite good and though he has a comic image, he slips into the role effortlessly. Abhishek Banerjee is dependable, as expected. Sumit Gulati and Aaditya Gupta also do well. Dhairya Karwa lends able support. The actor playing the jyotish and cop are fair.Vishal Mishra's music is forgettable. Both 'Diwali' and 'Hai Khuda' don’t register at all. Ketan Sodha's background score adds to the tension.Anshuman Mahaley's cinematography is terrific. The impact of a few scenes goes up thanks to the camerawork. Kristel Dias' production design is realistic. Anisha Jain's costumes are straight out of life. Salaam Ansari's action is as per the film’s mood. Shivkumar Panicker's editing is sharp.On the whole, APURVA is a well-made gripping thriller. 
  Tiger 3 Movie Review: TIGER 3 has SALMANIA written all over it with lots of seeti-maar moments 
 
 
 Sun, 12 Nov 2023 10:38:45 +0200 
 TIGER 3 is the story of a spy whose family is in danger. Avinash Singh Rathore aka Tiger (Salman Khan) goes on a dangerous mission to save Gopi (Ranvir Shorey) of R&amp;AW. Tiger rescues Gopi who in turn gives the former the information that Pakistan is planning a dangerous mission. Before breathing his last breath, Gopi also tells Tiger that his wife Zoya (Katrina Kaif), an ex-ISI official, is also a part of this mission. Tiger keeps a close tab on Zoya and realizes that she hasn't compromised. Maithili Menon (Revathy), the new chief of R&amp;AW, asks Tiger to go to St. Petersburg, Russia, and meet Jibran Shaikh (Neeraj Purohit), who has vital information. Tiger saves Jibran in the nick of time only to realize that Zoya is trying to assassinate the latter. Zoya then confesses that she is compelled to work for ex-ISI official, Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi), as he has kept their son Junior (Sartaaj Kakkar) hostage. Aatish tells Tiger and Zoya to head to Istanbul, Turkey for a dangerous mission that will make them most wanted in their respective countries. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Aditya Chopra's story is promising. Shridhar Raghavan's screenplay is fine but is unimaginative in several places. Anckur Chaudhry's dialogues lack the punch. A film like this should have had many more hard-hitting dialogues.Maneesh Sharma's direction is fine. To give credit where it's due, he handles the scale and grandeur like a pro. A few scenes are memorable like Tiger’s entry, Tiger getting suspicious of Zoya, Pathaan’s (Shah Rukh Khan) entry etc. The national anthem sequence in the climax will give goosebumps. Aatish’s flashback and his connection with Zoya is intriguing. Viewers will be fascinated to know that Tiger and Zoya almost came face to face before the events of EK THA TIGER [2012].On the flipside, the direction is not smooth and is incoherent in some scenes. The action gives a feeling of been-there-done-that. The sequence of Tiger and Zoya robbing the briefcase is very similar to Pathaan and Rubai (Deepika Padukone) stealing Raktbeej in Moscow. Also, the whole mission is to save Pakistan and this might not go down well with certain sections of the audience. The makers should have clearly highlighted that saving Pakistan was important in order to safeguard the interests of India.Speaking of performances, Salman Khan rocks the show. He underplays his part and looks great in action scenes. Katrina Kaif, too, gets the chance to shine. Her scenes in the hamam and the bunker are memorable. Emraan Hashmi looks dashing and tries his best to be menacing. But he is let down a bit by the script. Ranvir Shorey is fair in a cameo. Revathy and Simran (Pakistan PM Nasreen Irani) leave a mark. Kumud Mishra (Rakesh) is dependable. Anant Vidhaat (Karan), Chandrachoor Rai (Nikhil), Gavie Chahal (Abrar) and Danish Bhat (Javed) are okay. Vishal Jethwa (Hassan) and Sartaaj Kakkar don't get much scope. The same goes for Ridhi Dogra (Shaheen). Danish Husain (D G Riaz) and Shahid Lateef (General Haq) are passable. Aamir Bashir (Rehaan Nazar) passes muster. Michelle Lee (Gen Zimou) is too good. Lastly, Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan add to the star value as well as the mass element of the film.Tiger 3 Trailer | Salman Khan | Katrina Kaif | Maneesh Sharma | YRF Spy UniversePritam's music isn’t impressive. 'Leke Prabhu Ka Naam' is catchy but won’t have a shelf life. 'Ruaan' is more memorable for its situation than the tune. Tanuj Tiku's background score enhances the entertainment.Anay Om Goswamy's cinematography is spectacular. The various locales of the world are well captured. Mayur Sharma's production design is appealing. Franz Spilhaus, Oh Sea Young and Sunil Rodrigues' action is quite good when seen individually. But when compared with the films of the Spy Universe, it is not novel. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, Ashley Rebello and Darshan Jalan's costumes are stylish. yFX's VFX matches global standards. Rameshwar S Bhagat's editing is appropriate but isn’t smooth in a few scenes.On the whole TIGER 3 is a predictable action fare that has SALMANIA written all over it with lots of seeti-maar moments - Salman's introduction scene, Shah Rukh Khan's cameo, and the climax. At the box office, it will start huge due to the immense hype and is likely to emerge as a super hit. 
  The Marvels (English) Movie Review: THE MARVELS is a fun-filled superhero saga. 
 
 
 Fri, 10 Nov 2023 16:55:15 +0200 
 THE MARVELS is the story of a group of superheroes coming together for a greater cause. Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the leader of Hala, retrieves one-half of the Quantum Bands from the planet MB-418. She is searching for another band that she plans to use to save Hala though it will cause destruction elsewhere. Unknown to her, the other band or bangle is with Kamala Khan aka Ms Marvel (Iman Vellani) in Jersey City. Meanwhile, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) asks Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to investigate some glitch in the jump point. Monica and Carol touch the glitch-laden jump point at the same time. This results in both of them along with Kamala switching places through teleportation. The trio are unable to understand this phenomenon at first. Meanwhile, Dar-Benn is having a meeting with Emperor Dro'ge (Gary Lewis), the leader of the Skrulls at a refugee colony on planet Tarnax. The teleportation confusion leads them to the Tarnax and they start fighting with Dar-Benn's army. An enraged Dar-Benn destroys Tarnax. Carol, Monica and Kamala now decide to understand how and why they managed to switch, how they can control and what should be done to stop Dar-Benn. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik's story stands out from the rest of the Marvel films. Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik's screenplay is quite fresh and loaded with some fascinating and hilarious moments. The dialogues are entertaining and keep the narrative light.Nia DaCosta's direction is decent. She doesn't waste time and gets to the story from the first shot. The first 15-20 minutes are very entertaining as the superheroes get transported from one place to another, leading to madness. The Aladna sequence is short but sweet. The bond shared by the three heroes is also worth it. The scene of the flerkens (cat-like creatures) in the pre-climax takes the cake and brings the house down.On the flipside, THE MARVELS is the shortest film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one gets a feeling that it gets over soon. One expects more, especially in the climax fight. The villain track is weak. The whole bit about the trio teleporting is complex and the layman might not fully get it. A few developments are bewildering, especially why Carol never failed to repair Hala’s problems all these years. Lastly, the buzz for the film is very limited.Speaking of performances, Iman Vellani puts up a very entertaining act. The way she fangirls over Captain Marvel might give a déjà vu of Peter Parker's obsession with Iron Man in the SPIDER-MAN films. Yet, Iman adds her cuteness to ensure it doesn’t remind viewers of a similar mentor-protégé track in MCU. Brie Larson delivers a confident performance. Her bit of a goofy act in some scenes is likeable. Teyonah Parris is decent and gets overpowered by Brie and Iman. Samuel L Jackson is dependable as expected and raises laughs. Zawe Ashton is fine while Gary Lewis doesn’t get much scope. Park Seo-joon (Prince Yan) is too good and one wishes that he had a longer screen time. Zenobia Shroff (Muneeba; Kamala's mother), Mohan Kapur (Yusuf; Kamala's father) and Saagar Shaikh (Aamir; Kamala's brother) are fine.Laura Karpman's music has the trademark superhero movie stamp. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is appropriate. Cara Brower's production design is rich. Lindsay Pugh's costumes are stylish, especially the non-superhero outfits of the trio. Action is not disturbing at all. VFX is top-class. Catrin Hedström and Evan Schiff's editing is slick.On the whole, THE MARVELS is a fun-filled superhero saga. But due to limited buzz and immense competition from TIGER 3, it’ll need strong word of mouth to put up respectable numbers. 
  The Lady Killer Movie Review: THE LADY KILLER fails to entice 
 
 
 Fri, 03 Nov 2023 22:24:56 +0200 
 THE LADY KILLER is the story of a man who gets entangled in a mess. Rajendar Joshi (Arjun Kapoor) runs a chemist shop in Nainital. He wants to set up a diagnostic centre but the bank refuses his loan as he is a defaulter. He is in a relationship with Gajra (Priyanka Bose), a married woman. One day, Rajendar’s cop friend Rawat (Deepak Tokas) asks him to meet Vikram Burman (S M Zaheer), a former prince who is now settled in Nainital. Vikram wants to set up a hospital and Rajendar realizes that he might benefit. Rajendar goes to his mansion where he’s greeted by Vikram’s daughter Jansey (Bhumi Pednekar). Vikram gets attracted to her and is moved when he learns that Vikram sexually assaults her. Both decide to murder Vikram. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s story is fine and has a James Headley Chase feel. Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s screenplay, however, is not effective, especially in the second half. Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s dialogues are normal.Ajay Bahl’s direction is disappointing. He handles a few portions well in the first half like Rajendar and Jansey’s first meeting, the lovers deciding to murder, the intermission point and the day of the murder.From here on, things go downhill. Instead of giving a thrilling and nail-biting moments, the film will make viewers restless as they would wonder what exactly is happening. Moreover, there are gaps in the narrative. The entire track of Rajendar’s ex-girlfriend is not explained and one wonders why it is even there in the film in the first place. No explanation is given as to why the overdose of insulin didn’t have the desired impact. Lastly, it’s also bewildering that the cops failed to track the running lovers though they switched on their phones a couple of times.The Lady Killer (Trailer): Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi PednekarSpeaking of performances, Arjun Kapoor looks dashing and does well, more so in the finale. Bhumi Pednekar rocks the show. It’s a very difficult and challenging character but she pulls it off with ease. Priyanka Bose is terrific and her character’s actions save the film from becoming a disaster. S M Zaheer and Deepak Tokas are okay. Ekavali Khanna (Madhuri) and Denzil Smith (Dr Khurana) leave a mark.THE LADY KILLER is a song-less film. Ketan Sodha’s background score is intriguing. Anuj Dhawan’s cinematography is spectacular. The snow-capped ranges are beautifully captured by the lensman. Rita Ghosh’s production design is appealing. Eka Lakhani and Seerat Kaur’s costumes are stylish and at the same time, realistic. Aezaz Gulab’s action is fair.  Pranav Mistry’s editing is jerky.On the whole, THE LADY KILLER fails to entice because of a weak second half. At the box office, it got a token and a limited release with no buzz or awareness whatsoever and will therefore meet with a disastrous fate. 
  Aankh Micholi Movie Review: Besides a bad climax, AANKH MICHOLI fails to induce laughs.  
 
 
 Fri, 03 Nov 2023 11:41:49 +0200 
 AANKH MICHOLI is the story of two crazy families. Paro (Mrunal Thakur) lives in Hoshiarpur, Punjab with her father Navjot Singh (Paresh Rawal), brothers Harbhajan Singh (Abhishek Banerjee) and Yuvraj Singh (Sharman Joshi), Yuvraj's wife Billo (Divya Dutta) and nephew Goldie. Navjot has the habit of forgetting, Yuvraj is deaf and Harbhajan stammers. Paro, meanwhile, suffers from night blindness. While she is on a trip to Switzerland with her friends, Paro comes across Rohit Patel (Abhimanyu Dassani) and falls in love with him. But Rohit doesn't notice her. Once Paro is back, she is informed by her family that they have found a match for her for marriage. The guy turns out to be none other than Rohit. Paro, however, is not able to see him as Rohit arrives at her place at night, when she can't see anything. Paro's family, meanwhile, hasn't told the truth about Paro's night blindness to Rohit and his parents (Darshan Jariwala, Grusha Kapoor). Paro is asked to pretend that there's no issue with her vision. Billo, however, is determined to mess things up, especially after she learns that even she wasn't told about Yuvraj's deafness before marriage. But that's not all. Rohit is also hiding a big secret. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The story is promising and in the right hands, this would have been a laugh-a-minute-riot. The screenplay is not upto the mark and has limited humour. The dialogues are funny in places.Umesh Shukla's direction fails to do justice to the plot at hand. The beginning portions are shaky. Thankfully, the film gets watchable once Rohit comes to see Paro. The intermission point has an unexpected twist and works well. Post-interval, the film suffers as the comic scenes are not that effective. And though one doesn't have to look for logic in such films, yet the absurdities will astonish viewers. This is especially true in the climax. It won't be a surprise if the serious scene in the end elicits more laughs than the scenes which are actually meant to be funny!Abhimanyu Dassani is just decent at best. Mrunal Thakur has a superb screen presence and tries to rise above the substandard script. Paresh Rawal is dependable but looks a bit off in the initial scenes. Divya Dutta is too good and the best performer in the film. Sharman Joshi and Abhishek Banerjee are okay. Darshan Jariwala and Grusha Kapoor are passable. Vijay Raaz (Bhatti) tries his best to raise laughs.Aankh Micholi – Official Trailer | Abhimanyu Dassani, Mrunal Thakur, Paresh RawalSachin-Jigar's music is forgettable. The title song registers but 'Kaleja Kad Ke', 'Ve Dholna' and 'Shaadi Dope Hai' are poor. Sachin-Jigar's background score is in sync with the film's mood.Sameer Arya's cinematography is neat. Preeti Sharma's costumes are glamorous yet realistic. Parul Bose's production design is theatrical. Steven Bernard's editing is fine.On the whole, AANKH MICHOLI fails to induce laughs and is laced with a very bad climax. A film like this would be ideal for TV viewing and won’t stand a chance on the big screen. 
  Killers Of The Flower Moon (English) Movie Review: On the whole, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is worthy of the Oscars 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:53:15 +0200 
 KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is the story of a town rocked by a series of murders. The year is 1919. The town of Fairfax, Oklahoma is majorly populated with Native Americans who have become rich after the discovery of oil. William King Hale (Robert De Niro) resides in the same town and is considered a friend by the Native Americans. Unknown to them, he harbours hate for the community and wants to usurp their wealth. His nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns from the war after serving as a cook in the infantry. William asks him to turn taxi driver to earn a livelihood. Mollie (Lily Gladstone) becomes his regular customer. Sparks fly and they fall in love. Mollie suspects that Ernest wants to marry her for her wealth. Her sisters - Minnie (Jillian Dion), Anna (Cara Jade Myers) and Rita (JaNae Collins) - however disagree with her as they remind her that even Ernest's uncle is quite wealthy. Soon, Ernest and Mollie marry. William brainwashes Ernest that he'll get a greater share in the wealth if Mollie's family members die. William manages to kill Minnie through slow poisoning. Mollie's mother Lizzie (Tantoo Cardinal) dies due to old age. Anna is murdered at the orders of William. The doctors, who perform the post-mortem, hide the bullet. William devises a plan to kill Rita and also to slowly poison Mollie. When more than 15-20 members of their community die mysteriously, the Native Americans decide to fight back and find the root cause. Their attempts prove futile and yet, they continue to get to the bottom of these deaths. What happens next forms the rest of the film.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is based on the novel of the same name by David Grann. The story is incredible, and it’ll be shocking for the viewers to know that this incident took place in real life. Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese's screenplay is engaging but unnecessarily lengthy. The dialogues are normal and sharp in places.Martin Scorsese's direction is superlative. He has used his creativity at places and at the same time, given an old-school style treatment. His narrative is unhurried, and, in many ways, it works as audiences neatly adjust to the setting, characters and the goings-on. Some scenes are memorable like William and Ernest’s first meeting after the latter returns, the discovery of Anna’s body, the explosion scene, William assaulting Ernest, William’s breakdown in the jail etc. The scene of the effects of the slow poison on Mollie is gut-wrenching. The last scene of the film is amusing.On the flipside, the film has a run time of 3 hours 26 minutes. In other words, it is too lengthy. The film also drops in the middle and there’s a possibility that the audience might walk out of boredom and miss the second half, which is much better. Moreover, the treatment is not mainstream. Some aspects can be confusing, and it might be too much for the audience to remember.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is embellished with award-winning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio hits the ball out of the park and deserves another Oscar. Robert De Niro rocks the show yet again, as expected. Lily Gladstone is a surprise, and her career will zoom to another level after this performance. Tantoo Cardinal is decent. Jillian Dion and JaNae Collins get no scope. But Cara Jade Myers leaves a mark. Jesse Plemons (Tom White) lends able support. Brendan Fraser (W S Hamilton) is nice but gets no scope. The other actors who do well are Scott Shepherd (Byron), Tommy Schultz (Blackie), Pete Yorn (Acie Kirby) and Sturgill Simpson (Henry Grammer)Robbie Robertson's music is unique and enhances impact. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is quite stunning. Jack Fisk's production design is reminiscent of the bygone era. Jacqueline West's costumes are detailed and realistic. Action is minimal but very gory. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing should have been crisper.On the whole, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is worthy of the Oscars, especially for its performances. But due to the extremely long length and niche appeal, it’ll find it difficult to pull in the audience. 
  Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video Movie Review: On the whole, SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO rests on the bravura performances of Nimrat Kaur and Radhika Madan 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:33:43 +0200 
 SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO is the story of a missing girl. Sajini Shinde (Radhika Madan) is a physics teacher at K P School, Pune. Her authoritarian father Suryakant Shinde (Subodh Bhave), mother Urmila (Sneha Raikar), uncle Sadashiv (Shashank Shende) and brother Aakash (Ashutosh Gaikwad) reside in Ahmednagar. Her dominating fiancé Siddhant Kadam (Soham Majumdar) works in an IT company in Bengaluru. Sajini travels to Singapore with her colleagues, Shraddha (Shruti Vyas) and Chhavi (Rashmi Agdekar), for work purposes. At night, Sajini celebrates her birthday at a nightclub. She gets drunk and dances with two skimpily-clad men. Shraddha shoots her video on her phone. While sending work-related pictures to the school group, she mistakenly transfers Sajini’s video as well. The school management is shocked. The video leaks on the internet and goes viral. Due to the pressure from the management and teachers, principal Kalyani Pandit (Bhagyashree) is compelled to fire Sajini, Shraddha and Chhavi. Sajini is shattered. She’s too scared to call her father. Siddhant, meanwhile, blasts her for her ‘mistake’. The next morning, Sajini disappears. She posts a message on her social media account wherein she declares that she’s about to end her life. She blames her father and Siddhant for her drastic step. Inspector Bela Barot (Nimrat Kaur) is assigned the case. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Mikhil Musale and Parinda Joshi's story is interesting and raises some important points. Mikhil Musale and Parinda Joshi's screenplay (additional screenplay by Anu Singh Choudhary and Kshitij Patwardhan) is captivating. The writing, however, gets a bit shaky in the second half. The dialogues pack a punch, especially the ones mouthed by Nimrat Kaur.Mikhil Musale's direction is good and much better than his work in his previous outing, MADE IN CHINA [2019]. He has kept the duration in check. He neatly introduces the characters and their equation with each other. The climax is unpredictable. A few scenes stand out like Inspector Ram Pawar (Chinmay Mandlekar) referring to Bela as Doberman, the meeting between the lawyers and the co-accused, the reporter remarking that she would have fallen for Siddhant’s lies if she hadn’t known him earlier, etc.On the flipside, a few scenes are difficult to comprehend like Bela discovering the message of Sajini’s sister. In fact, the focus shifts from the investigation to what is happening in the lives of Sajini’s loved ones. Though it is important, one starts missing Bela and her investigation. The track of the influencer is unconvincing. There are a lot of Marathi dialogues in the film, which restricts its appeal in the North.Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video | Trailer | Nimrat Kaur, Radhika Madan, BhagyashreeSpeaking of performances, Nimrat Kaur is terrific, and this is surely her best performance to date. One will be surprised to discover this side of her personality in this film. One wishes this film is a success so that a sequel can be made, and we can see her character yet again. Radhika Madan, too, puts her best foot forward and is like the soul of the film. Soham Majumdar, of KABIR SINGH [2019] fame, is superb and proves that he’s a fine talent. Subodh Bhave and Chinmay Mandlekar are dependable as expected. Shruti Vyas is good but is let down by the writing. Rashmi Agdekar is fine but gets a raw deal. Bhagyashree is lovely and apt for the part. Ashutosh Gaikwad is fair. Kiran Karmarkar (Yashwant Desai) and Sumeet Vyas (Lalit) are too good. Kavi Shastri (Jayant) is wasted. Akshay Tanksale (Milind) is okay.Sachin-Jigar's music is forgettable. 'Nana Chi Taang' is well-woven into the script, though. Hitesh Sonik's background score is in sync with the mood and theme of the film.Tribhuvan Babu Sadineni's cinematography is neat. The locales of Pune and the surrounding areas are well-captured. Swapnil Bhalerao and Madhur Madhavan's production design is great. Shivank Vikram Kapoor's costumes are straight out of life. The ones worn by Nimrat are quite appealing. Javed Karim's action is minimal and is fine. Sumeet Kotian's editing is slick.On the whole, SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO rests on the bravura performances of Nimrat Kaur and Radhika Madan and raises some important issues. But due to negligible buzz, the film will face a very tough time at the box office. 
  12th Fail Movie Review: 12TH FAIL is a well-intentioned inspiring saga. 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 11:19:17 +0200 
 12TH FAIL is the story of a man who rises against all odds. The year is 1997. Manoj Kumar Sharma (Vikrant Massey) lives in Chambal with his family. His father (Harish Khanna) has been suspended for his honesty. Manoj, meanwhile, appears for his 12th exams confidently though he hasn't prepared properly. This is because the school teacher himself is going to help the students in cheating. The plan gets foiled as Dushyant Sharma (Priyanshu Chatterjee), the newly appointed DSP, stops the malpractice. As a result, all the students fail, including Manoj. When Dushyant rescues Manoj's brother from corrupt cops, he realizes how power in the hands of an honest officer can bring positive change. Manoj expresses a desire to be like Dushyant. Dushyant asks him to not resort to cheating to become successful like him. After clearing his 12th exams successfully, Manoj graduates with BA and moves to Gwalior to appear for PCS exams. The exams, however, are discontinued, prompting Manoj to head to Delhi to appear for the IPS exams. Manoj develops cold feet when he sees the amount of people who have assembled just like him to change their fortunes. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's story, based on true events, is superb. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's screenplay is engaging. This is not an easy topic but the master filmmaker-writer manages to pen an interesting script that keeps the interest going. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's dialogues are sharp and clapworthy.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's direction is top notch. The impact in certain sequences is enhanced due to the creativity in the form of long shots, novel camerawork, background noise to depict realism etc. Some scenes that stand out are the beginning scene, Dushyant saving the life of Manoj's brother and the subsequent conversation, Gauri bhaiya (Anshuman Pushkar)'s entry, the intermission point, Manoj meeting his father at the flour mill etc. The climax is gripping while the final scene is touching.On the flipside, a few developments seem convincing. The track of the love interest's family is not exciting. Manoj lying to Shraddha (Medha Shankar) is not well explained especially when he's very truthful otherwise. The finale is touching but it gives a déjà vu of THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS [2006] and 3 IDIOTS [2009]. Moreover, the film has a film festival-type treatment, which restricts its appeal. Lastly, the soundtrack is poor.Vikrant Massey gets into the skin of his character. It’s difficult to believe that he’s not a villager turned IAS aspirant since he has given a very realistic portrayal. This is easily his best performance for sure. Medha Shankar is lovely and puts up a confident performance. Anant Vijay Joshi (Pritam Pandey) is likeable. Anshuman Pushkar leaves a huge mark. Priyanshu Chatterjee wins hearts with his cameo appearance. Harish Khanna is decent. Sarita Joshi (Manoj’s grandmother) is entertaining. Vikas Divyakirti (Teacher) delivers a stupendous performance. Geeta Agrawal Sharma (Pushpa; Manoj’s mother) doesn’t get much scope.12th Fail – Official Trailer | Vidhu Vinod Chopra | In Cinemas WorldwideShantanu Moitra's music is poor. 'Restart' does get registered but is not a song which will have a long shelf life. Shantanu Moitra's background score is much better. Manav Shrotriya's sound design is award-winningRangarajan Ramabadran's cinematography is eye-catching, be it the scenes of Chambal or that of the crowded Mukherjee Nagar in Delhi. It’s also commendable that the film has been shot in real locations. Prashant Bidkar's production design is realistic. The same goes for Malvika Bajaj's costumes. Jaskunwar Kohli and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's editing is well-paced.On the whole, 12TH FAIL is a well-intentioned inspiring saga. At the box office, it will find the going tough since the awareness about the film is near-zero. 
  Tejas Movie Review: TEJAS suffers due to a lack of logic and too many cinematic liberties. 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 11:05:14 +0200 
 TEJAS is the story of a brave officer. Tejas Gill (Kangana Ranaut) is a wing commander in the Indian Air Force. She and her colleague Arfa (Anshul Chauhan) are about to get suspended after they save an officer Vivek (Kashyap Shangari) from a prohibited area in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Vivek is thankful to Tejas and asks her out for a date. Tejas agrees but is still under the trauma of losing her parents and boyfriend Ekveer (Varun Mitra) during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. One day, news comes in that an engineer named Shikhar Ali has been captured by terrorists in Pakistan. They ask for Kashmir in return for his release. Videos of Shikhar being nabbed are viral on the internet. Tejas sees his videos and realizes that he’s none other than her batchmate, Prashant (Vishak Nair). She also realizes that he has used Morse code to send his location, which is Mir Ali. Tejas informs about it to the IAF chief R K Panicker (Ashish Vidyarthi). She also requests him to allow her to go to Pakistan and rescue Prashant. Panicker agrees. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Sarvesh Mewara's story has all the trappings of a blockbuster. Sarvesh Mewara's screenplay, however, is silly. The narrative is riddled with scenes of convenience and also gives a deja vu of films DUS [2005], CAPTAIN PHILLIPS [2013], MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, TOP GUN: MAVERICK [2022] etc. Sarvesh Mewara's dialogues are just fine.Sarvesh Mewara's direction is not upto the mark. To give credit where it's due, some scenes are well executed like the sequence of the tribals and the 26/11 attack. He also packs in a lot in 118 minutes.Sadly, the minuses outweigh the plusses. The film defies logic and how. After a rocking intro scene, the film falls when it’s shown that Tejas is the only one in her class to know about the Tejas aircraft. But the fact is that any IAF aspirant would know these basic details. Later, Tejas is the only one among all the defence officials in the country to guess that Prashant has used Morse code to send his location. When Tejas tells her senior that she wishes to go to Pakistan, we assume that the latter will have some hesitation. Instead, the senior officer straight away agrees as if infiltrating into Pakistan is akin to a cakewalk! Then the manner in which Tejas hides the aircrafts at the Pakistani airport is a smart idea but looks childish on screen.Kangana Ranaut delivers a fine performance but looks quite stiff in scenes where she’s supposed to look rough and tough. Anshul Chauhan lends able support and also raises laughs. Ashish Vidyarthi is dependable. Varun Mitra is lovely while Kashyap Shangari gets no scope. Sunit Tandon (Academy teacher) leaves a mark. Vishak Nair is okay. Rohed Khan (Sarqalam), Rio Kapadia (RAW Chief) and Mohan Agashe (Prime Minister) do well. Mushtaq Kak (Khatooni) hams.Tejas Official Trailer | Kangana Ranaut | Sarvesh Mewara | Ronnie ScrewvalaShashwat Sachdev's music fails to register. 'Jaan Da' and 'Aag Udi' are the best of the lot while the rest of the songs like 'Dil Hai Ranjhana', 'Reh Jao Na' and 'Ishq Hai Ranjhe Da' are forgettable. Shashwat Sachdev's background score is uplifting.Hari K Vedantam's cinematography is appropriate. Harpal Singh Barda, Vikram Dahiya and Amin Khatib's action is entertaining. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is passable. Rohit Chaturvedi's costumes are realistic. After Studios and Creative Doctor's VFX is tacky and very poor. Aarif Sheikh's editing is fine though it could have been crisper.On the whole, TEJAS suffers due to a lack of logic and too many cinematic liberties. At the box office, it is likely to meet with a disastrous fate as there is hardly any buzz or excitement around the movie. 
  Ganapath – A Hero Is Born Movie Review: On the whole, GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN fails to impress. 
 
 
 Fri, 20 Oct 2023 17:32:33 +0200 
 GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN is the story of a man who is meant for greatness. The year is 2070. Due to a major war, the poor have become poorer. They live in a settlement where the rich control the food and water supply. The rich, meanwhile, reside in the luxurious Silver City. A mysterious man named Dalini rules this territory. His trusted aide, John (Ziad Baki), conducts boxing matches and earns money through the bets placed by the uber-rich. Guddu (Tiger Shroff) works for John along with his uncle Kaizad (Jameel Khan) and Senior (Girish Kulkarni). The latter detests Guddu. One day, John asks Guddu to take his girlfriend Rosie (Elli AvrRam) out to a nightclub while he’s busy in a meeting. Rosie gets physical with Guddu. John catches them red-handed and buries them alive. Miraculously, Guddu survives. Kaizad asks him to move away to a settlement of poor people up in the hills and meet Shiva (Rahman). Once he meets Shiva, Guddu is supposed to tell him ‘Ganapath is here’. Guddu does as instructed. He meets Shiva and his close confidante, Jassi (Kriti Sanon). Shiva is blind while Jassi is tough and fights quite well. Unknown to Guddu, he is Ganapath or the saviour of the poor, as predicted by a revered man (Amitabh Bachchan). But while Guddu is good at analysing fighters and their strengths and weaknesses, he’s not a fighter himself. Shiva and Jassi decide to train him. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vikas Bahl's story is clichéd and gives a déjà vu of CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA [2009]. Vikas Bahl's screenplay is unexciting. A few scenes are well thought of but they give a been-there-done-that feeling. Vikas Bahl's dialogues are just fine.Vikas Bahl's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit its due, he has handled a few dramatic moments well. Guddu’s transformation also makes for a nice watch. The fight at the intermission point is worth it. The lead actors have also been presented stylishly.Sadly, the film is riddled with shortcomings. The futuristic element could have been the USP but the makers fail to do justice to it. The poor VFX further messes things up in this regard. For a film about one man fighting the system, it’s mandatory that the audience should be moved by the plight of the have-nots and be wowed by the protagonist’s heroism. Both these factors are missing. Moreover, the twist in the climax is very predictable. One can guess it from a mile away.Speaking of performances, Tiger Shroff has never looked so dashing. His performance is quite good. Kriti Sanon gives a sizzling performance. She looks convincing while doing action. Amitabh Bachchan is hardly there and is fine. Ziad Baki is decent. Jameel Khan and Girish Kulkarni are dependable. Rahman is the surprise of the film. Elli AvrRam looks hot but is wasted. Jess Liaudin (Tabahi) is over the top. Shruthy Menon (Shaina) is fine.Ganapath Official Hindi Trailer | Amitabh Bachchan, Tiger Shroff, Kriti SanonSongs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Sara Zamana' manages to register to an extent followed by 'Jai Ganesha', 'Hum Aaye Hain', 'Lafda Kar De' and 'Time 2 Shine'. Salim-Sulaiman's background score is passable.Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is neat. Amit Ray &amp; Subrata Chakrobarty's production design is unimaginative. Aki Narula, Sukriti Grover and Akangshe Chopra's costumes are quite cool, especially the ones worn by Tiger and Kriti. Tim Man and Vikram Dahiya's action is entertaining and not at all gory. After Studio, Number 9 VFX and Maadfam Studios' VFX is tacky. Ritesh Soni's editing is appropriate.On the whole, GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN fails to impress due to a clichéd storyline, poor VFX and predictable second half. At the box office, the limited buzz and huge costs will prove detrimental. 
  Yaariyan 2 Movie Review: On the whole, YAARIYAN 2 is a decent entertainer. 
 
 
 Fri, 20 Oct 2023 17:04:05 +0200 
 YAARIYAN 2 is the story of three cousins. Laadli Chibber (Divya Khosla Kumar) lives in Shimla with her mother (Lillete Dubey). She was suffering from thalassemia but has now recovered. Laadli wanted to fall in love and then get married. Her mother, however, asks her to meet Abhay Singh Katyal (Yash Das Gupta). Both click and they decide to get married. Laadli immediately calls Shikhar (Meezaan Jafri) and Bajrang Das Khatri aka Bajju (Pearl V Puri), her cousins who are closest to her, for her wedding. After marriage, Laadli moves to Mumbai with Abhay. Bajju, too, works in Mumbai. Shikhar is forced to shift to Mumbai and work as a delivery boy after he faces a roadblock in his biking career. Laadli faces trouble in marriage as Abhay seems indifferent to her. Shikhar changes his SIM card and gets hounded with calls from Ikroor (Anaswara Rajan). He meets her and both fall in love. Bajju, meanwhile, begins a relationship with Shona (Warina Hussain). Shikhar, however, has reservations about Shona and her behaviour. This causes a rift between the trio. What happens next forms the rest of the film.YAARIYAN 2 is based on BANGALORE DAYS [2014] and the story is promising. We have seen films about siblings and friends. A film about cousins is rare. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's screenplay flows well and is replete with some nice dramatic and emotional sequences. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's dialogues are youthful and modern. However, the dialogue about nappies is repeated far too many times.Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's direction is creative. The director duo is known for adding a lot even to their ordinary shots. This trademark stamp is visible from start to finish. While they handle all tracks well, the track of the dead girl's parents is very moving. The race sequence, meanwhile, is gripping.On the flipside, there's hardly any comedy. For a film about friendship, there should have been more humour. The character of Bajji gets a raw deal in the second half as he is hardly there. Moreover, at 150 minutes, the film is too lengthy.Speaking of performances, Divya Khosla Kumar looks charming and performs the difficult role with ease. Meezaan Jafri shows a marked improvement compared to his work in HUNGAMA 2 [2021]. Pearl V Puri is decent but could have been better. Yash Das Gupta emerges as the best performer in the film. Warina Hussain looks stunning but could have done better in some difficult scenes. Bhagyashri Borse (Raajlaxmi) looks stunning and leaves a mark. Anaswara Rajan is lovely but goes over the top in emotional scenes. Priya Prakash Warrier is wasted. Murli Sharma is dependable. Lillete Dubey hams.Yaariyan 2 (Official Trailer): Pearl V Puri, Divya Khosla Kumar, Meezaan JafriThe songs are decent though it's in no way close to the hit soundtrack of YAARIYAN [2014]. 'Saure Ghar' is the best followed by 'Simroon Tera Naam', 'Oonchi Oonchi Deewarein', 'Suit Patiala', 'Heer Bhi Roye', 'Peene De' and 'Bewafaa Tu'. 'Sunny Sunny 2.0' and 'Blue Hai Paani Paani' are just okay. JAM8's background score is functional.C R Ravi Yadav's cinematography is stunning. Mumbai has never been captured like this before. Shankar Samanta's production design is rich. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's costumes are glamorous, especially the ones worn by Raajlaxmi. Allan Amin's action is fine. Abhishek Kumar Singh's editing is weak. The film should have been shorter by 15-20 minutes.On the whole, YAARIYAN 2 is a decent entertainer. 
  Dhak Dhak Movie Review: DHAK DHAK is a well-intentioned genuine effort laced with some fine performances. 
 
 
 Fri, 13 Oct 2023 12:00:57 +0200 
 DHAK DHAK is the story of four women bikers. Sky (Fatima Sana Shaikh) is a vlogger specializing in bikes. She breaks up with her boyfriend Shrey (Nishank Verma) after her nude pictures are leaked from his phone. She wants to bag a contract to film the Barcelona Auto Expo. The person in charge, Nishant Kakkar (Hrriday Malhotra), agrees but on one condition - she should create a video series that will emotionally move people. This is when she comes across Manpreet Kaur Sethi aka Mahi (Ratna Pathak Shah). She is in her 60s and rides a motorcycle after she wins the two-wheeler in a contest. Mahi tells Sky that it's her dream to ride her bike at Khardung La Pass, the highest motorable road in the world. Sky agrees to take her there knowing that this is the story she wants to tell. When both try to get their bike fixed, they bump into Uzma (Dia Mirza). She comes on board as a mechanic. Then they are joined by Manjari (Sanjana Sanghi), a god-fearing vegetarian from Govardhan who lies to her parents that she's flying to Leh instead of going there by road. All four of them have distinct personalities and the journey is tough and full of obstacles. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's story is brilliant and waiting to be told. Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's screenplay does partial justice to the plot at hand. The characters are beautifully fleshed out and at the same time, they also raise some important issues. However, things don’t get properly established in the second half. Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's dialogues (additional dialogues by Anvita Dutt) are simple and some one-liners raise laughs.Tarun Dudeja's direction is uncomplicated, despite the flashbacks. He begins the film by establishing that the four ladies have embarked on their biking trip. He then depicts their back stories and it makes for an engaging watch. It is not easy for women travelling alone and this aspect is depicted perfectly. At the same time, not everyone tries to take advantage and this is also taken care of by the beautiful truck driver sequence. Sky’s outburst, the reunion in the pre-climax and the finale are also worth watching.Sadly, the film is not without its share of blemishes. Nothing much happens in the first hour of the post-interval portion. The four ladies spare Moshe (Benedict Garrett) despite his wrongdoing and this is difficult to digest. The same goes for the sequence when Manjari’s parents allow her to continue her journey on a bike, though they are livid with her. A few aspects like Mahi being ignored by her family and her bond with Prabjyot (Harshpal Singh) are not established well. The conclusion of Uzma’s track is too simplistic. Lastly, it is bewildering how no one from the ashram delivers the oxygen cylinder to a hospitalized Mahi. Agreed that Manjari was not in a position to do so but anyone else should have done the needful, especially when it was a life-and-death situation.Dhak Dhak – Official Trailer | Ratna Pathak Shah | Dia Mirza | Fatima Sana Shaikh | Sanjana SanghiAll four leading heroines do a fine job. Fatima Sana Shaikh has the maximum screen time and carries off the role with panache and style. Ratna Pathak Shah as always is a pleasure to watch. Dia Mirza is too good and she underplays her part with panache. Sanjana Sanghi goes a bit overboard in some scenes but otherwise, she puts up a fine act. Nishank Verma lends able support. The same goes for Hrriday Malhotra. Harshpal Singh is there only in the beginning and is okay. Dheerendra Dwivedi (Shabbir; Uzma's husband) leaves a mark. Kallirroi Tziafeta (Martha; Manjari’s foreign friend) is lovely while Dr Lakha Lehri (Taran; truck driver) is adorable. Ozgur Kurt (Bernett) is too good. Benedict Garrett is forgettable and hams. Poonam Gurung (Kung Fu Nun) is great, but her track doesn’t have the desired impact.DHAK DHAK has several songs but only 'Re Banjara' and 'Akhiyan Criminal' get registered. The rest of them like 'Sadke Sadke', 'Woh Tara', 'Safar Pe Chale' and 'Farzi Duniya' are forgettable. Anurag Saika's background score is in sync with the film’s theme.Sreechith Vijayan Damodar's cinematography is splendid. The locales of the mountain ranges, especially, are captured beautifully. Nilesh Eknath Wagh's production design is realistic. Natasha Vohra's costumes reflect the character’s personalities. The ones worn by Fatima are appealing. Abdul Aziz Khokhar's action is minimal. Manish Sharma's editing is slick.On the whole, DHAK DHAK is a well-intentioned genuine effort laced with some fine performances by the leading ladies. But due to a weak second half and negligible buzz, the film will suffer at the box office. 
  The Exorcist - Believer (English) Movie Review: On the whole, THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER fails to impress. 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 18:48:20 +0200 
 THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER is the story of two girls who get possessed. The year is 2010. Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr) visits Port Au Prince, Haiti with his pregnant wife Sorenne (Tracey Graves). An earthquake takes place that severely injures Sorenne. She dies but the baby survives. 13 years later, Victor is settled in Percy, Georgia with his daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett). One day, Angela makes a plan with her classmate Katherine (Olivia Marcum) to go to the woods after school. When they don't return, their worried parents call the cops. The police officers try their best but are unable to locate their whereabouts. 3 days later, Angela and Catherine are found in a barn 30 miles away from the woods. Shockingly, they have no memory of how they reached the barn, that too without shoes. On top of that, they believe that they were gone only a few hours. Once back home, both Angela and Catherine start behaving weirdly, scaring their parents. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Scott Teems, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green's story is promising. Peter Sattler and David Gordon Green's screenplay, however, is devoid of tension and scary moments. The dialogues are normal.David Gordon Green's direction is just okay. The director sets up the story well initially. The sequence of the earthquake and that of the missing girls is very captivating. Moreover, getting the character from the first part, THE EXORCIST [1973], is a masterstroke.Unfortunately, the makers fail to utilize this trump card to its potential. Firstly, many are not aware that the character they see on screen has a connection with the first part. The makers should have established it well. Secondly, the second half is clichéd and something we have seen countless times before. The film also ends abruptly, probably because a sequel is in the offing.Leslie Odom Jr doesn't put on a nice act and is emotionless in several scenes. Lidya Jewett and Olivia Marcum, however, are excellent in their respective parts. Tracey Graves is lovely in a cameo. Norbert Leo Butz (Tony; Katherine's father) and Jennifer Nettles (Miranda, Katherine's mother) are decent. The same goes for E J Bonilla (Father Maddox) and Ann Dowd (Ann). Okwui Okpokwasili (Dr Beehibe) doesn't have much to do.David Wingo and Amman Abbasi's is functional. Michael Simmonds' cinematography is appropriate. Brandon Tonner-Connolly's production design is nothing special. VFX is minimal and works. Tim Alverson's editing is sharp.On the whole, THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER fails to impress due to a weak and clichéd second half. At the box office, it'll face a tough time though the association with the brand EXORCIST might attract a tiny section of the audience. 
  Thank You For Coming Movie Review: On the whole, THANK YOU FOR COMING is a progressive film 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:51:32 +0200 
 THANK YOU FOR COMING is the story of a girl trying to find love. Kanika Kapoor (Bhumi Pednekar) lives in Delhi with her mother Beena (Natasha Rastogi) and nani Kishori (Dolly Ahluwalia). Since she was a child, she has been shamed for being raised by a single mother and for her liberal views. She gets involved with several guys and it never translates into a healthy, long-term relationship. She is about to turn 32 and is shattered that she hasn't found her prince charming yet. Moreover, she has never experienced an orgasm in her life. On her birthday, Arjun Malhotra (Karan Kundra) shows interest in her and gets invited to her party. However, he lands up at the bash with a date, Rushi Kalra (Shehnaaz Gill). Rushi and Kanika become friends and the former advises the latter that she should marry someone who loves her. She finds that person in Jeevan (Pradhuman Singh), a simpleton selling toilet showers and who loves her immensely. Kanika agrees to marry him though her mother and her best friends - Pallavi (Dolly Singh) and Tina (Shibani Bedi) - advise her against doing so. At the engagement party, she calls her ex-boyfriends like Booni Bhatia, Shekhar Sinha, Rahul Kasturia (Sushant Divgikar), and Professor (Anil Kapoor). She drinks like crazy at the engagement party. The next day, she wakes up with no memory of the previous night. But she does remember that she experienced orgasm for the first time ever. However, she doesn't remember who she slept with - was it Jeevan or Booni or Shekhar or Rahul or Professor? What happens next forms the rest of the film.Radhika Anand's story is promising and could have translated into a path-breaking film. Radhika Anand's screenplay, however, is a mixed bag. While some scenes are very impactful and entertaining, a few of them could have been penned in a better manner. Radhika Anand and Prashasti Singh's dialogues are too funny but only in select places. A character in the beginning remarks that she attains orgasm simply by looking at her hot body. This dialogue will bring the house down and ideally, the film should have been replete with such one-liners from start to finish.Karan Boolani's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, he touches upon some important topics like childhood traumas, women being shamed for living life on their terms, women being shamed by other women, the majority of women not experiencing orgasm ever etc. Instead of getting preachy, he uses humour and some touching scenes to convey the message. Moreover, the plot is outrageous and one does get intrigued especially when Kanika begins her mission to find out who she slept with on her engagement.On the flipside, the film moves too quickly and doesn’t let the characters grow organically. Kanika’s decision to marry Jeevan seems sudden. Moreover, it’s bewildering that the makers never show what Kanika and her friends do for a living. Professional achievements are also important for women. But the women in the film are not focusing on it at all. The humour is limited and moreover, the finale at the school is quite silly.Thank You For Coming | Official Trailer | Bhumi Pednekar | Shehnaaz GillSpeaking of performances, Bhumi Pednekar plays the character with aplomb. For an actor who played these semi-urban and rural characters, it can be challenging to crack a part that is so drastically different. Bhumi, however, comes out with flying colours. Dolly Singh and Shibani Bedi lend able support. Pradhuman Singh is unrecognizable and does well. Natasha Rastogi is lovely and Dolly Ahluwalia is dependable, as expected. Shehnaaz Gill is entertaining but is hardly there. Kusha Kapila (Neha) is wasted. Gautmik (Karan; Pallavi's husband) and Saloni Daini (Rania Das; Tina's daughter) leave a mark. Sushant Divgikar is quite good and has a fine screen presence. Karan Kundrra is okay. Anil Kapoor is excellent in a cameo.Songs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Desi Wine' works the best followed by 'Pari Hoon Main', 'Haanji' and 'Baaraat'. None of the songs, however, are of the chartbuster variety. Aman Pant's background score is functional.Anil Mehta's cinematography is neat. Manisha Melwani and Devanshi Tuli's styling is one of the highlights of the film. Disha Dey's production design is realistic. Shweta Venkat Mathew and Manan Sagar's editing is too sharp.On the whole, THANK YOU FOR COMING is a progressive film that raises some important topics, has its share of entertaining scenes, and delivers a shock value. But it suffers on account of the script, limited humour, and silly climax. At the box office, the lack of awareness will prove detrimental to its business, and it will be appreciated only by a tiny section of the multiplex audience. 
  Mission Raniganj Movie Review: On the whole, MISSION RANIGANJ makes an impact due to the subject 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:37:30 +0200 
 MISSION RANIGANJ is the story of a man trying to rescue miners against all odds. The year is 1989. Jaswant Singh Gill (Akshay Kumar) is a rescue officer and is based in Raniganj, West Bengal. On November 11, hundreds of miners descend into the mine of Mahabir Coillery at night. An underground blast goes wrong and water starts gushing with powerful force. The miners attempt to escape. Several of them safely make it to the ground. But a group of 65 miners get stuck. The next morning, Jaswant volunteers to rescue the miners. D Sen (Dibyendu Bhattacharya), who is a local contact, however, attempts to take over the rescue operation. He comes up with a plan and tries to save the miners. However, his plan fails. On the other hand, Jaswant finds out the highest point in the underground mine. He then drills a hole at that very place and attempts to establish contact. The miners, too, realize that they need to be at the highest point for better chances of rescue. With great difficulty, they try to reach there but get stuck due to a stoppage wall between them and the highest point. Meanwhile, time is running fast and Jaswant needs to rescue them before they drown or die by inhaling a poisonous gas present in the mine. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Deepak Kingrani's story (story idea by Poonam Gill), inspired by a true incident, is intriguing. Vipul K Rawal's screenplay is engaging. The writer has peppered the narrative with dramatic and tense moments. Deepak Kingrani's dialogues are okay. A film like this should have had more powerful dialogues.Tinu Suresh Desai's direction is superb. At 138 minutes, he has kept the duration in check. He has packed in a lot and also kept things simple for most parts. The obstacles that Jaswant encounters from locating the miners to establishing contact to manoeuvring politics make for a great watch. Some scenes that stand out are Jaswant offering water to a lady in distress, Jaswant convincing the railway officer to slow down the speed of the trains, the intermission, Jaswant establishing contact with the miners, Jaswant promising O P Dayal (Shishir Sharma) that he’ll have tea with him next day etc. The finale is nail-biting.On the flipside, the first half is a bit weak and doesn’t create the desired impact. The VFX is poor. Lastly, there are cinematic liberties in the finale which take away the realism.Speaking of performances, Akshay Kumar’s beard looks a bit unreal. But his performance packs a punch as expected. One can’t help but root for him in this mission. Parineeti Chopra (Nirdosh) puts up a nice act but her role seems forced. Kumud Mishra (R K Ujjwal) is fine but showing him smoking in all scenes gets too much after a point. Dibyendu Bhattacharya is dependable. The same goes for Pavan Malhotra (Bindal) and Virendra Saxena (Tapan Ghosh). Rajesh Sharma (Govardhan Roy) is over the top. From the miners, Ravi Kishan (Bhola) and Jameel Khan (Pasu) leave a mark followed by Sudhir Pandey (Behra), Varun Badola (Shaligram), Mukesh Bhatt (Murli), Bachan Pachehra (Noor; dog-lover) and Omkar Das Manikpuri (Bishu). Shishir Sharma (O P Dayal) is fair. Rajit Kapur and Ananth Narayan Mahadevan are hardly there.Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue | Official Trailer | Akshay KumarThe songs are disappointing. 'Jalsa 2.0' is well-shot while 'Jeetenge' and 'Keemti' fail to register. Sandeep Shirodkar's background score has a commercial vibe.Aseem Mishra's cinematography is appropriate. Sheetal Iqbal Sharma's costumes are realistic. Amrish Patange and Dayanidhi Patturajan's production design is detailed and well-researched. VFX is very bad. Parvez Shaikh's action is fair. Aarif Sheikh's editing is just right.On the whole, MISSION RANIGANJ makes an impact due to the subject, clap worthy moments in the second half, nail-biting moments and Akshay Kumar’s performance. At the box office, the negligible buzz can affect its prospects and it will need a strong word of mouth to make the desired impact. 
  Dono Movie Review: DONO is a clean family entertainer and works due to its simplicity. 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Oct 2023 22:00:12 +0200 
 DONO is the story of two strangers falling in love. Dev Saraf (Rajveer Deol) is based in Bengaluru and runs a start-up named Primary Workflow Solutions. The business is not going great. On top of it, Alina (Kanikka Kapur), his best friend since childhood and whom he loves dearly, is getting married. Dev declines to be a part of the festivities. But he changes his mind as he feels that attending her marriage can help him find closure. He flies to Hua Hin, Thailand where the marriage is taking place. There, he bumps into Meghna Doshi (Paloma), a close friend of the groom, Nikhil (Rohan Khurana). Another close friend of Nikhil, Gaurav (Aditya Nanda), is also present. He happens to be the ex-boyfriend of Meghna. Both broke up just a month ago. Dev and Meghna are poles apart. While he’s unable to come to terms that the love of his life is getting married, Meghna seems to have moved on rather well. Yet, both get attracted to each other. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Avnish S Barjatya's story is nothing special. There’s hardly any storyline. Avnish S Barjatya and Manu Sharma's screenplay is engaging and is peppered with sweet and simple moments. However, the writing gets stretched after a point. Avnish S Barjatya and Manu Sharma's dialogues are devoid of any over-the-top one-liners and are very situational.Avnish S Barjatya's direction is uncomplicated. He understands the technicalities like a pro, despite being a debutant director. Also, just like the style of his father Sooraj Barjatya, his content is devoid of any intimacy or violence. It’s a complete, clean family entertainer. The situations in the film are very relatable be it domination by a partner, the quest to find closure, unrequited love, hypocrisy of the society involving womenfolk etc. Also, the troubles and fun associated with a destination wedding, especially when it’s abroad, make for a great watch. Some characters and comical scenes like the cricket match, Dev-Meghna's meeting at the pani puri stall, etc, add to the humour.On the flipside, at 156 minutes, the film is too lengthy. After a point, it becomes tedious to sit through the film. Secondly, the track of Dev and his parents is very unconvincing. It is strange that Dev is meeting his parents after three years at the Thailand wedding. Yet, he’s not shown spending time with them. Some factual errors distract viewers. For instance, Dev coolly says that he has a flight in 2 hours. Yet, he’s seated in his hotel which is more than an hour's drive from the nearest airport!Both Rajveer Deol and Paloma look great on screen and have a fine presence. However, they need to fine-tune their craft. Kanikka Kapur is decent. Aditya Nanda plays his character with panache. Manik Papneja (Gopal aka Gappu) is superb and raises a lot of laughs. Poojan Chhabra (Vilas) also adds to the fun. Rohan Khurana gets no scope. Sanjay Nath (Jagmohan; the groom’s father) is excellent as the man who never smiles. Micky Makhija (Dilip Saraf)’s performance suffers due to the writing. Mohit Chauhan (Ashok Jaisingh) leaves a mark in the beginning but later on, he doesn’t have much to do. Tisca Chopra (Anjali Malhotra) hams. Varun Buddhadev (young Dev) and Muskan Kalyani (young Alina) are lovely.Dono: Official Trailer | Rajveer Deol, Paloma Thakeria, Avnish S. BarjatyaShankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music doesn’t have a shelf life. The title song is the most memorable one. 'Khamma Ghani' is based on an interesting idea.

The film could have been shorter by at least 15 minutes.On the whole, DONO is a clean family entertainer and works due to its simplicity, relatable goings-on and some funny and emotional moments. At the box office, it’ll need a strong word of mouth to attract its target audience. 
  Khufiya Movie Review: On the whole, KHUFIYA is a well-made gripping saga. 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:24:36 +0200 
 KHUFIYA is the story of a mole in India’s intelligence agency. The year is 2004. Krishna Mehra (Tabu) works for the Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) and is based in Dhaka. She comes across Heena Rehman (Azmeri Haque), who offers to spy for India in exchange for money, which she desperately needs for her father’s illness. Krishna agrees and while working with her, both fall in love. Unknown to Krishna, Heena is sent on a mission to eliminate Brigadier Mirza (Shataf Figar). Before she can do so, Mirza is informed of the plan. He eliminates Heena. A few months later, Krishna's boss Jeev (Ashish Vidyarthi) learns that Ravi Mohan (Ali Fazal), an employee at RAW, told Bangladesh about Heena's involvement, leading to her death. His office is bugged and that's when the RAW finds out the truth about Ravi. But to gather more evidence, his house too is riddled with surveillance cameras. Krishna, too, is made a part of this operation which she names 'Brutus'. While spying on them, Krishna learns about Ravi's bond with his wife Charu (Wamiqa Gabbi), son Kunal (Swastik Tiwari) and Ravi's mother Lalita (Navnindra Behl). At the same time, Krishna also gets the shock of her life when she finds out who Ravi is actually working for. What happens next forms the rest of the film.KHUFIYA is based on the book 'Escape To Nowhere' by Amar Bhushan. The story is one of the strengths of the film as it's very arresting. Rohan Narula and Vishal Bhardwaj's screenplay does justice to the superb plot in hand. The focus is chiefly on the characters and the madness that ensues in their lives. Vishal Bhardwaj's dialogues are sharp and well-worded.Vishal Bhardwaj's direction is exemplary and this is one of his best works. We have seen films in this zone like PARMANU (2018), RAAZI (2018), BABY (2015) or even in Hollywood like MUNICH [2005] to name a few. Thanks to his execution, one doesn't think of these films or draw parallels with them. Not a single moment is boring as a lot is happening. A few twists are unexpected and will leave audiences amazed. At the same time, the way the equation between certain characters changes is seen to be believed.On the flipside, a few developments are confusing. It also takes a while to realize that the flashback has commenced or ended. A simple text like 'Dhaka - 6 months ago' would have been helpful. Secondly, the way our agencies are able to hoodwink foreign officials in multiple places is a bit hard to digest. The climax is gripping but could have been more nail-biting.KHUFIYA begins with a very memorable scene and sets the tone. If you feel the film will drop as the makers would take their time to introduce characters, you are mistaken. The makers waste no time in explaining the situation of Ravi. A few scenes that stand out are Krishna and her team bugging Ravi's house, Charu dancing to 'Yeh Jawani Hai Diwani', Krishna's son blasting her mother, and what could be said as the interval point. In the second half, the scene where Ravi argues with his mother is funny. The pre-climax and climax are too good.Speaking of performances, Tabu yet again gets to play a meaty role and she makes good use of it. There's no false note in her act and as always, it’s a pleasure to see her in such challenging parts. Wamiqa Gabbi once again hits the ball out of the park after her acts in JUBILEE and CHARLIE CHOPRA &amp; THE MYSTERY OF THE SOLANG VALLEY. She is fully convincing as the bored housewife who is at heart a filmy bug and a devastated mother who has lost the will to live. Here's hoping she continues her great work as a talent like hers is rare. Azmeri Haque is the surprise of the film. She's sure to become a talking point after the film's release. Ali Fazal gets a bit overshadowed but leaves a mark nevertheless. Navnindra Behl is a bigger surprise of the film. See it to believe it! Shataf Figar and Ashish Vidyarthi are decent. Atul Kulkarni (Shashank) is fine in a special appearance. Swastik Tiwari, Lalit Parimoo (Home Minister Naren Mishra), Rahul Vohra (Wasan), Disney James (Kutty), Jan Graveson (Rachel Mcclane), Meet Vohra (Vikram; Krishna's son), Virendra Vashisht (Sardar old man in RAW), Shashi Bhushan (Michael; who is spying from milk centre), Geeta (Priyanka Setia; Michael's associate), Alexx O Nell (Dr David Langley) and Monica Rae (Langley's wife) are fine in small roles. Rahul Ram (Yaar Jogiya) is superb.Vishal Bhardwaj's music doesn't have a shelf life but is well woven into the narrative. 'Mat Aana' is the best of the lot followed by 'Bujhee Bujhee' and 'Mann Na Rangaave'. 'Tanhaai Hai' and 'Naa Hosh Chaley' are okay. Vishal Bhardwaj's background score adds to the thrill and mystery.Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi's cinematography is commendable. The locales of Alberta are well captured. T P Abid's production design is detailed. Karishma Sharma's costumes are realistic. The same applies to Harpal Singh's stunts. A Sreekar Prasad's editing is razor sharp.On the whole, KHUFIYA is a well-made gripping saga. It works big time due to the intriguing plot, tight screenplay, twists and turns and exemplary performances by Tabu and Wamiqa Gabbi. 
  Fukrey 3 Movie Review: FUKREY 3 is a well-packaged entertainer and a fun ride 
 
 
 Tue, 26 Sep 2023 21:35:40 +0200 
 FUKREY 3 is the story of good-for-nothing guys entering politics. After the events of the second part, Hunny (Pulkit Samrat), Choocha (Varun Sharma), Lali (Manjot Singh), and Pandit (Pankaj Tripathi) continue to run the store provided to them by the Delhi government. However, the business is down. Meanwhile, Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadha), has stood for elections on a ticket of Janhit Samaj Party. She asks Hunny, Choocha, Lali, and Pandit to help her and use Choocha’s ‘Deja Chu’ if needed. However, during the campaign, Choocha, unintentionally, steals the show and becomes the favourite of the aam junta. The foursome decide that Choocha should also fight the elections and defeat Bholi, who they believe, would not do anything worthwhile for the residents once she wins. However, campaigning requires money which the Fukrey gang doesn’t have. This is when they get an opportunity from South Africa. Shunda Singh Ahluwalia (Manu Rishi Chadha) owns a mine and is struggling to find diamonds. Choocha is invited there to help them locate diamonds through the use of ‘Deja Chu’. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vipul Vig’s story is crazy but very entertaining. Vipul Vig’s screenplay (additional screenplay by Mrighdeep Singh Lamba) is superb. The script is peppered with very funny and outrageous moments that are sure to bring the house down and catch viewers by surprise, especially the hydrocarbon idea. There are issues in the script, but those are minor ones thankfully. Vipul Vig’s dialogues (additional dialogues by Mrighdeep Singh Lamba) are hilarious and add significantly to the fun quotient. The use of English dialogues for Pandit are also smartly incorporated to induce laughter.Mrighdeep Singh Lamba’s direction is terrific. One needs a lot of conviction to pull off a script that is as absurd as this one and ensure that the audience doesn’t look for logic. Instead, thanks to his direction, the audience would be too busy laughing instead of asking questions. A few scenes will amaze viewers. For instance, to show the fan ‘reacting’ when Bholi mentions her full name is nothing short of a masterstroke. The other scenes that work are the echo sequence, Lali busy preparing tea while his friends are busy in a crucial discussion, Choocha campaigning in a tank, the African young girl crying her guts out etc.Sadly, FUKREY 3 is not without its share of blemishes. The film dips in the South Africa episode. The pre-climax is too serious and looks out of place in a laugh-a-minute-riot like this film. The ending is simplistic. The track of Shunda should have had more meat in the second half, especially because he has a clear reason to be angry with the Fukrey gang. Certain important characters of the series are missing in the film and the makers don’t provide explanation why is that so. Lastly, the toilet humour gets too much after a point.FUKREY 3 belongs to Varun Sharma. Choocha has a huge fan base and he rocked the show in the first 2 parts. In the third installment, Varun once again ensures that he fulfills people’s expectations. Pulkit Samrat, too, delivers an entertaining performance. His six-pack abs are sure to get a response in cinemas. Pankaj Tripathi is adorable. He kills it with his performance and the makers, too, give him some witty and funny lines to mouth. Richa Chadha is powerful yet again. In a few scenes, she’s also vulnerable and that gives an interesting arc to her character. Manjot Singh gets dominated a bit but he gets his share of crazy sequences to shine. Manu Rishi Chadha is okay and doesn’t get much to do after a point. The actor playing Dhingra is too good as the villain. The actress playing Mumbasa is cute and performs ably.All the songs are in the background and are well woven into the narrative. The title song and ‘Rabba’ are the best of the lot. The recap song is played in the opening credits is witty and is helpful as it provides a recap of the first two parts. Abhishek Nailwal’s background score enhances the impact. The theme of the antagonist is memorable.Amalendu Chaudhary’s cinematography is terrific and very novel. It’s rare to see such supreme camerawork in mid-sized comic films. Some shots that stand out are Choocha enjoying the slide at the water park, the tricolor visible on Shunda’s sunglasses, the underwater shot of the crocodile etc. Theia Tekchandaney’s costumes are a little flashy and it is apt for the characters in the film. Manohar Verma’s action is realistic. Sandeep Meher’s production design is straight out of life. Manan Ashwin Mehta’s editing is slick.On the whole, FUKREY 3 is a well-packaged entertainer that works due to the crazy and hilarious script, strong brand value, and the extreme popularity of the characters, especially Choocha. At the box office, the film will reap the benefit of the long-extended weekend which will keep the producers and the distributors happy. 
  The Great Indian Family Movie Review: THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY rests on a promising storyline but fails to impress 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:03:36 +0200 
 THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY is the story of a devotional singer. Ved Vyas Tripathi (Vicky Kaushal) lives in Balrampur with his deeply religious family comprising Pandit Siya Ram Tripathi (Kumud Mishra), bua Sushila Kumari (Alka Amin), chacha Balak Ram (Manoj Pahwa), chachi Hema (Sadiya Siddiqui) and twin sister Gunja (Srishti Dixit). Ved is also known as Bhajan Kumar since he's a reputed devotional singer in the town. Ved's best friends are Bhaata (Bhuvan Arora) and Sarveshwar (Ashutosh Ujjwal). Sarveshwar falls for Jasmeet (Manushi Chhillar) and the former asks Bhaata and Ved for help to impress her. While doing so, Ved falls for Jasmeet. This creates a rift between Ved and Sarveshwar. If that is not enough, Ved gets another shocker. A stranger arrives at their house and leaves a letter informing them that Ved was born a Muslim. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vijay Krishna Acharya's story is very promising and has all the trappings of a commercial entertainer. But Vijay Krishna Acharya's screenplay is not upto the mark. The writer-director tries his best to add dramatic moments but these scenes fail to pack a punch. Vijay Krishna Acharya's dialogues are sharp in places.Vijay Krishna Acharya's direction gets affected due to an underwhelming script. To give credit where it's due, he has handled certain moments with panache like Ved’s childhood track, Ved meeting Abdul and his family for the first time, the climax monologue etc. The idea of the family undertaking a vote before a crucial decision and also the snakes-and-ladder aspect is creative. The message of communal harmony also comes across well.However, a film like this should have ideally had more humour and more hard-hitting scenes. THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY has neither. The goings-on that occur after Ved’s Muslim identity is revealed doesn’t create the desired impact. The romantic track is also weak.The Great Indian Family Trailer | Vicky Kaushal, Manushi Chhillar | Vijay Krishna AcharyaSpeaking of performances, Vicky Kaushal, as always, puts up a very sincere act. The scene in the second half where he struggles to speak while crying is damn good and shows his acting brilliance. Manushi Chhillar has an arresting screen presence. But she is wasted. In fact, she is hardly there in the film after the first 45 minutes. Kumud Mishra leaves a mark. He is also convincing as an influential town resident. Manoj Pahwa, too, performs well. Alka Amin, Sadiya Siddiqui and Srishti Dixit lend able support. Bhuvan Arora and Ashutosh Ujjwal are okay. Yashpal Sharma (Pandit Jagannath Mishra) and Aasif Khan (Tulsidas Mishra) are decent as the antagonists. Hittesh Arrora (Abdul) and Devang Tanna (Pintu) are likeable. Saloni Khanna (Aishwarya) and Paritosh Sand (Jai Prakash Malpani) don't have much to do.Pritam's music won’t have a long shelf life. All three songs - 'Kanhaiya Twitter Pe Aaja', 'Sahibaa' and 'Ki Farak Painda Hai' - are beautifully shot and choreographed but are not catchy enough. Kingshuk Chakravarty's background score is appropriate.Ayananka Bose's cinematography is neat. Sumit Basu, Snigdha Basu and Rajnish Hedao's production design is very authentic and a layman won’t be able to realize that the whole film has been shot on a set and not in real-life locations. Sheetal Sharma's costumes are straight out of life. YFX's VFX is top-class. Charu Shree Roy's editing is fine.On the whole, THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY rests on a promising storyline but fails to impress since the script and goings-on don’t pack a punch. At the box office, the film will struggle due to a lack of awareness. 
  Expend4bles (English) Movie Review: EXPEND4BLES is a poor show due to the weak storyline 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Sep 2023 12:31:22 +0200 
 EXPEND4BLES is the story of a group of mercenaries avenging their friend’s death. The Expendables get a new mission from Marsh (Andy Garcia) of CIA. They are told to head to Libya and prevent a mercenary, Rahmat (Iko Uwais), from stealing a nuclear detonator, which the latter plans to give to the mysterious Ocelot. While the Expendables try to land at an airstrip in Libya, they are attacked by Rahmat's army. Almost all of them get down from the plane and attack Rahmat's men. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), however, keeps flying the aeroplane and indulges in aerial aggression. Sadly, the plane is shot down. Barney is believed to be dead. The Expendables is devastated. On top of it, Marsh asks them to go after Ocelot and Rahmat, but without Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) since he jeopardized the mission while trying to save Barney. But Christmas is not ready to lie down while his friend died a brutal death. He manages to track and follow his group members. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Spenser Cohen, Kurt Wimmer and Tad Daggerhart's story is just okay. Kurt Wimmer, Tad Daggerhart and Max Adams' screenplay is not up to the mark. We have seen far more exciting moments in the previous films of the franchise. The dialogues are just fine.Scott Waugh's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, he has handled the grandeur and action like a pro. Some scenes are too good like Barney and Christmas’s fight in the bar in the beginning, Christmas and Gina’s (Megan Fox) playful face-off before hitting the bed, The Expendables being ambushed on the ship etc. The finale is also arresting.On the flipside, though the team tries its best, the action moments fail to compel viewers to break into applause or whistles. The villain is weak. The intention of a positive character to turn antagonist is not convincing enough. The bromance is also an important aspect of THE EXPENDABLES franchise and even that is lacking in adequate doses. Lastly, the absence of subtitles makes it difficult to decipher certain dialogues, especially those of Jason Statham.Speaking of performances, Sylvester Stallone is quite good but his screen time is limited. He’s like the face of the franchise. Hence, fans will be disappointed to see that he is in an extended guest appearance. Jason Statham gets the maximum screen time and he’s superb as always. Megan Fox is sizzling and puts up a very good act. 50 Cent (Easy Day), Dolph Lundgren (Gunner), Randy Couture (Toll Road), Jacob Scipio (Galan) and Levy Tran (Lash) don’t get much scope. Iko Uwais has an arresting screen presence but again, gets side-lined after a point. Andy Garcia is okay. Tony Jaa (Decha) leaves a huge mark.Guillaume Roussel's music is fine and in sync with the film's genre and theme. Tim Maurice-Jones' cinematography is neat. The production design is apt. Neil McClean's costumes are stylish and make the characters look cool. VFX is shockingly tacky in a few scenes. The action is a bit violent, as expected, and works. Michael J Duthie's editing is slick.On the whole, EXPEND4BLES is a poor show due to the weak storyline, unexciting action and limited screen time of Sylvester Stallone.

 EXCLUSIVE: Vipin Sharma to turn author with his book ‘One Way Ticket’; says, “It’s not an autobiography” 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:03:20 +0200 
 Actor Vipin Sharma, who is still remembered for his act in Taaze Zameen Par, is all set to turn an author. Titled ‘One Way Ticket’, his book will be about his life but not an autobiography. Sharing the news exclusively with Bollywood Hungama, Sharma said, “I wanted to write a book that actually inspires people. If I can contribute something from my journey to someone, that will be the biggest achievement. I really hope that it encourages someone to fulfil their dream.”Sharing more details, the actor added, “I don’t want to talk about my life as much as I want to talk about the creative process, the joy of wanting to do things you really love. It’s more of that. So, it’s not an autobiography in that sense. It’s about things I have learnt over the years; people who have influenced me and I have learnt from. The book can motivate anyone and everyone from any walk of life and not just actors. It will have my experiences of working with filmmakers, actors and colleagues from the fraternity. It will also include my entire process of not just acting but also my voyage to where I have reached today.”Sharing an example of the same, Sharma said, “How I quit smoking is something very important in my life. It’s been over 15 years now. So, I want to share those things that made a difference in my life, so that it can make a difference in someone else’s life. It’s not just about health. I tell people that if you quit smoking, there will be miracle in your life.”When asked about the release, he said, “We are thinking of releasing it in December this year. I feel it should come when we are ready. But most probably by the end of this year.” The actor said that he has signed up with the literary consultants The Sunflower Seeds to release the book.Apart from Taare Zameen Par, Vipin Sharma is also known for films like Paan Singh Tomar, Gangs Of Wasseypur, Special 26, Raanjhanaa, Kick, Hotel Mumbai, etc, and shows like Paatal Lok, The Family Man and Guns And Gulaabs.Along with the likes of Irrfan Khan and Ali Fazal, he is also one of the few Bollywood actors of this era to dabble in international cinema. His film Dear Jassi was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He is a part of the keenly-awaited Hollywood film Monkey Man, which stars Dev Patel in the lead. Sharma will soon be leaving for South By South West Film Festival in Austin for its premiere. He will also be attending the film’s screenings in Los Angeles and London later.Speaking about Monkey Man, Sharma said, “This is a very important film. It was shot during the pandemic. It was a new lease of life because I hadn’t gone out for seven months before this shoot. It was a blessing to suddenly just go to an island and be there for five and a half months during a very difficult time. It became very special. And working with Dev Patel was amazing.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Author Harinder Sikka starts Third Innings Productions with Rahul Nanda

 EXCLUSIVE: Author Harinder Sikka starts Third Innings Productions with Rahul Nanda 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 14:57:50 +0200 
 Author Harinder Sikka, whose book Calling Sehmat was converted into the film Raazi, has started a production house along with his partner Rahul Nanda.Sharing the news exclusively with Bollywood Hungama, Sikka said, “I have launched a company by the name Third Innings Productions LLP. My partner is Mr Rahul Nanda, who is arguably the biggest publicist in Mumbai. He is the son of the legendary Gulshan Nanda, who wrote films like Kati Patang, Khilona, etc. Rahul Nanda made posters for my first film Nanak Shah Fakir, which won three National Awards, including the award for Best Film on National Integration. I discuss every small and big thing with Rahul Nanda. He is a mentor for me as far as Bollywood is concerned.”Sharing his aim as a producer, Sikka added, “I wanted to launch such a platform for writers (so) that they get their due. Not only during starting stage but they also should get shareholding in the film. This is rare and perhaps not acceptable by most of the people, but we will do that. Content provider is the king.”Harinder Sikka has bought the rights of author Tarun Mehrishi’s debut novel ‘The Portrait Of A Secret’ to turn it into a film. It tells the real story of an Indian intelligence officer who is faced with the task of averting a nuclear attack on India. As per the name of the book, a portrait plays an important role in the story. “It is a real-life story,” said Sikka. “I know the protagonist personally who did it. He put his mind, career and life at stake at times to bring back the portrait. That portrait is priceless. The masses are loving it. The book is selling as hot cakes in schools and colleges.”When asked whether he has thought of a director to helm the project, he said, “First and foremost is the screenplay. That takes a very long time. Once that is done, we will discuss with some top names.”During the course of the chat, Sikka said that he has a close association with filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani and he wishes to collaborate with him some day. “Raju Hirani is someone I admire and trust blindly. He is a very dear friend of mine. I have spoken on length on various issues with him. I am sure we will do some work together in times to come. When I do not know. But the fact is that I trust him. That’s a huge statement by me for anybody. I get insights on what to do and what not to do (from him),” he said.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: “Made a blunder by handing Calling Sehmat to Meghna Gulzar to make Raazi,” says Harinder Sikka as Maddock Films buys rights of his next book Vichhoda

 Yami Gautam starrer Article 370 declared "tax-free" in Madhya Pradesh 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 14:09:23 +0200

 Following the super success of Baipan Bhari Deva, Kedar Shinde, Jio Studios announce Aaipan Bhari Deva 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 12:01:40 +0200 
 Filmmaker Kedar Shinde’s Marathi movie Baipan Bhari Deva not only became a success at the box office but also became one of the biggest blockbusters in the language. Produced by Jio Studios and Shinde, the movie starred an ensemble cast of female actors like Rohini Hattangadi, Vandana Gupte, Deepa Parab, Suchitra Bandekar, Sukanya Kulkarni Mone and Shilpa Navalkar. Now, the makers have announced a sequel to the film titled Aaipan Bhari Deva.The announcement was made today by Jio Studios and Shinde. The makers haven’t revealed whether the film will take forward the same story and will have the same cast.Speaking about the film, Shinde said, “Baipan Bhari Deva has taught me valuable lessons. I made the film for my mother, my wife, my daughter, my aunt and my grandfather. With each film, we take away learnings, but its overwhelming response inspired me to understand better and delve deeper into a woman’s mind. With success comes responsibility, and while planning my next film, I thought being a mother has so many facets and a mother’s emotions are like a bottomless sea, why not make a film dedicated to all mothers? Aaipan Bhari Deva is not just for all women…but for every human being… Because everyone has a mother. I’m looking forward to partnering once again with Jio Studios who backed me on my vision for Baipan Bhari Deva and are committed to compelling storytelling. With Aaipan Bhari Deva, we hope to once again deliver a film that will cut across all audiences and leave an enduring impact.”Interestingly, in an exclusive chat with Bollywood Hungama in last July, Shinde had said that he will make a sequel to Baipan Bhari Deva only if he finds a good script. He had said, “There is a lot of responsibility. It’s not easy. The film has become a tremendous brand, so I will get money (if I make a sequel). But I need to think whether I should concentrate on making money or be concerned about losing the respect I have in audience’s hearts. I would never want that respect to go. The day I feel that this is the perfect script for Baipan 2 only then I will make it. But right now there is no such plan.”Aaipan Bhari Deva is produced by Kedar Shinde Productions, Jyoti Deshpande and Bela Shinde, co-produced by Ajit Bhure and written by Vaishali Naik and Omkar Mangesh Dutt.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Baipan Bhari Deva had to wait 3 years for release: “It was a tough period, I didn’t know what was Swami Samarth’s wish,” says Kedar Shinde

They would land here, shoot a match for maybe eight-ten days and there would be a lockdown again. This happened to us thrice.”Maidaan makers also suffered losses due to the Mumbai Cyclone in 2019 which led to the destruction of their sets. Boney Kapoor is grateful that the team and crew members did not lose patience at all and were eager to complete the film. “In all this, it was not only about hard work, but also about having patience. As a team we didn’t lose patience and I am glad we didn’t,” he said.Talking about the delay, director Amit Ravindernath Sharma said, “It was frustrating. You prepare and shooting does not happen, it was natural to be frustrated. When the shooting happened, we used to enjoy it and that’s how we completed the whole thing.”Based on a true story, Maidaan is directed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma of Badhaai Ho fame, and also features Priyamani, Gajraj Rao, and the well-known Bengali actor Rudranil Ghosh.Produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Arunava Joy Sengupta and Akash Chawla, the screenplay and dialogues are written by Saiwyn Quadras and Ritesh Shah respectively, music is by AR Rahman and lyrics by Manoj Muntashir Shukla.

 EXCLUSIVE: Badshah says The Paagal Tour is an homage to his community: "The divide between East and West in entertainment and music is diminishing" 
 
 
 Wed, 06 Mar 2024 12:10:35 +0200 
 Amid unprecedented anticipation for his third studio album, acclaimed hip hop artist of Indian origin, Badshah has just announced his long-awaited return to the global performing arena with The Paagal Tour 2024; he will travel to Canada and the USA for the very first time later this year. With a long-term vision to solidify the Indian hip-hop brand imprint overseas, he will be embarking on an expansive global summer tour from May to August of this year.Currently, a 6-date arena run with stops across Toronto (May 31st), Vancouver (June 1st), San Francisco (June 7th), Houston (June 8th), Dallas (June 9th) and New Jersey (June 15th) have been announced. Tickets will go live for general sales on Ticketmaster and Sulekha on 1st March 2024. Additional dates for cities such as Singapore, Washington DC, Los Angeles and the Netherlands will be announced for the next few weeks.Touring in support of his much-awaited third studio album Ek Tha Raja, the upcoming global showcase was previously premiered in India with a sold-out 10-city trek and will couple stellar visual storytelling with state-of-the-art production. The tour with its fresh format will entail a 3-hour show and embrace an eclectic setlist of over 30 songs. Fans can expect to be regaled with some of his all-time radio hits such as ‘Jugnu’, ‘Paani Paani’, ‘Garmi’, ‘DJ Waale Babu’, ‘Lets Nacho’, ‘Kala Chashma’, ‘Kar Gayi Chull’, ‘Genda Phool’, ‘Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai’ and ‘Paagal’, amongst others.Speaking to Bollywood Hungama about his anticipated world tour, Badshah says, "Grateful and privileged. The Paagal Tour is an homage to my community, symbolizing the power to achieve dreams, shatter stereotypes, and transcend boundaries. Live performances are the highlight of my career. India's cultural richness is something to be proud of, and I salute every Indian contributing to a positive global image. We've moved beyond mere labels, proving our worth. The divide between East and West in entertainment and music is diminishing, fostering more cross-cultural exchange and equal opportunities on both sides."While Badshah has delivered singular global performances over the past few years—such as his sold-out shows across London, Leeds, Dubai and Abu Dhabi - The Paagal Tour 2024 will mark the rapper’s first-ever multi-city global arena trek of a considerable scale.The nomenclature of the tour, suggestive of a celebration of the 38-year-old’s artistry and legacy over the last decade, aptly sums up Badshah’s sentiments of the unprecedented run as he prepares to hit the road and set a brand new milestone for the Indian hip hop industry.Recently rapper-entrepreneur-philanthropist grabbed headlines for becoming the first-ever Indian hip-hop artist to headline the mainstage of UNTOLD which is ranked as the world’s #6 music festival and Europe’s #3 music festival by DJ Mag.Badshah states, “Grateful and blessed. This year has kickstarted on an extremely electrifying note and I’m appreciative that I’m getting to do everything that I’m truly passionate about. The Paagal Tour is about the ability to conquer your dreams, break stereotypes and transcend boundaries- inspire to be inspired. See you in the arenas soon for one of my most experimental and never-before-seen live show experiences to date! Love and peace!”Originally due in 2023, his upcoming album Ek Tha Raja was ultimately pushed back to 2024. In a message to his fans announcing the postponement, Badshah assured his audiences that his latest album would be worth the longer-than-expected wait. Billed as the biggest gift the artist has ever presented to his global fan community, the full album will be released sometime in mid-March 2024 and will feature a slew of top-ranking collaborators. The first single from the album ‘Daaku’ which was released earlier this week was trending across all digital streaming platforms.

 Sushant Singh Rajput Case: Sister Shweta Singh Kirti requests CBI to provide proof of her brother’s death; says. “There are a lot of things which do not make sense” 
 
 
 Wed, 06 Mar 2024 11:57:51 +0200 
 The sudden demise of popular Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput left the nation in shock. The actor, reportedly, was found hanging on the ceiling fan of his bedroom at his Mumbai apartment about three and half years ago. Since then, the case has been under investigation. His sister Shweta Singh Kirti, who was quite close to the actor, has now yet again requested the CBI to investigate and give them proper answers about his demise.In an interview with Ranveer Allahabadia, Shweta Singh Kirti revealed about how several things about her brother’s demise doesn’t make sense and has requested the CBI to investigate further to get to the truth.  “I am not an investigator, I cannot investigate the case. I was not allowed to enter Bhai’s flat. I haven’t seen his flat where it all happened. I cannot investigate. I want CBI to tell us what happened. Whatever happened, give us proof and let us know,” she told during the interview.She also explained about how certain things were not adding up as she shared, “We can really come together and plead to CBI to tell us what exactly happened. There was not enough space the between bed and the fan to hang himself. When you leave an apartment, you have to return the keys. The person who deals with that apartment told us that the keys of his room were missing. Why? Where did it go? They had given the keys. Sushant never used to lock his room’s door. That day, his door was locked. All nearby CCTVs were also not working that day. There are a lot of things which do not make sense.”However, she asserted that she continues to hold on to faith and trusts the authorities to get to the bottom of this. “They are the best investigators in the country. They will be able to figure out something. I am sure they will find out something. If it was a suicide, tell us about it, tell us how did it happen,”Also Read: Bombay High Court quashes LOCs issued against Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and father in Sushant Singh Rajput case

 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 20:47:43 +0200 
 While speculations about Alia Bhatt joining the blockbuster YRF Spy Universe has been hitting headlines for nearly 6 months now, Yash Raj Films’ CEO Akshaye Widhani confirmed this huge development today at FICCI Frames! When prodded constantly to reveal one new development within the YRF Spy Universe, Akshaye said, “I'll share the worst kept secret in the industry, which is, that Alia Bhatt is headlining a Spy Universe film and that the schedule starts later this year. But you know, talking about this spy universe, we are just so thrilled and excited about having this IP in the studio.”He adds, “I think the YRF Spy Universe is a financial and cultural juggernaut. And as one of the most prized IPs, we take a lot of pride in it. So there's a lot of stuff that's going to come on the spy universe. We're going to see more and more films getting made under it. But of course, not going to share everything here. But we will talk about it at a more opportune time. But for now, I can just say that Alia Bhatt is headlining a spy universe film.”
⁩
Alia Bhatt is set to team up with young and rising Bollywood star Sharvari Wagh in the yet-to-be-titled film. They will play super-agents in the action entertainer! The YRF Spy Universe kicked off with Salman Khan’s Ek Tha Tiger (2012) then followed by Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and War (2019), starring Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff. It was taken forward with Pathaan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and John Abraham and then Tiger 3 with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif. Now, the next project will be War 2 starring Hrithik Roshan, NTR Jr. and Kiara Advani and directed by Ayan Mukerji.Akshaye also touched upon the super successful year YRF has had on streaming with The Railway Men, about the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, being a global hit show! It trended at Number three on Netflix! The Romantics, a docu-series on YRF and its impact on Pop culture for 50 years, also became a global success story.Akshaye says, “The Railway Men trended in over 36 countries, but you feel the success of content when you know people who don't speak your language, are watching the content and appreciating it. For me, that is a huge definition of success. We are a company that is not afraid to fail. We want to be able to do disruptive content.He adds, “India loves the movies. It's a big part of our culture, it's a big part of our team. And I think The Romantics was a journey that every viewer went on. So everybody has a YRF story in their life. My parents had a YRF story from Yash Ji's times. I had a YRF story from Adi's times. So like me, there are other people who all have a YRF story. There is a song that played at your wedding, which was from a YRF movie. There was a time in life when you went watch a movie and that was a YRF movie and you went with that certain someone which you might be with or might not be with, but you still have fond memories of.”Akshaye further says, “I think, because of that connect, and connect with this company, and the studio has had it, it's a cultural connect with audiences. And I think that's what excited people and drew people to watch the Romantics that would make them love it more. The sheer nostalgia here, as to the youth connected to them, because again, there was a story about their family, or a movie that they have watched and loved. Not to forget, it also had Aditya Chopra making his debut on screen and that gave us incredible amount of eyeballs!”Also Read: BREAKING: Yash Raj Films delays Tiger vs Pathaan; Shah Rukh Khan-Salman Khan starrer will go on floors only in 2025 and release in 2026

 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 13:23:12 +0200 
 Renowned comedian Sunil Pal has recently voiced his disapproval of the promotional material for Kapil Sharma's forthcoming show, The Great Indian Kapil Show, slated to stream on Netflix. Taking to Instagram, Pal expressed concerns over the alleged use of inappropriate language in the promotional videos.In a video shared on his Instagram handle, Pal commended Kapil Sharma as a comedic icon beloved by millions for his family-friendly entertainment. However, he raised objections to what he perceived as the use of vulgar language in the promotional content for the upcoming show on the OTT platform.Pal stated, "After watching the promo videos of the upcoming show on OTT, I am disappointed. Kapil Sharma is our comedy superstar. He is the king of comedy and people love him as a family entertainer. But his new show is coming now on OTT, and in its promo, I see filth, the use of dirty words. I feel like my language will be defeated here, and I cannot watch it. Kapil, I am your biggest fan, but you have to stop this... not just for me but for millions of your fans."Expressing his reservations about other team members, including Krushna Abhishek and Kiku Sharda, Pal appealed to Sharma to maintain the wholesome nature of his comedy. He urged Sharma to consider the impact of his content on his vast fan base, emphasizing the importance of steering clear of what he referred to as "filthy" elements.Furthermore, Pal criticized the promotional tactics employed by the OTT platform, likening it to the promotion of a "porn quota." He cautioned against succumbing to the influence of what he termed as "obscene elements," urging Sharma to distance himself from such content creators.&nbsp;

 Shahid Kapoor to replace Salman Khan in Sooraj Barjatya directorial Prem Ki Shaadi? Here’s what we know 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 13:19:22 +0200 
 In a surprising turn of events for fans eagerly awaiting the next Sooraj Barjatya directorial venture with Salman Khan, the family drama, Prem Ki Shaadi, has hit a creative block. Salman Khan, who was set to star in the film, has reportedly decided to amicably step away from the project due to creative disputes with the director. With the fifth venture on the cards after Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Hum Saath Saath Hain, and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, expectations were high for Prem Ki Shaadi. However, it seems like Barjatya is determined to move forward with the film and has reportedly approached Shahid Kapoor to take on the lead role. The actor had worked with the director on Vivah.Touted as an ambitious project set to grace the silver screen on a grand scale, sources close to the production revealed that Shahid Kapoor's name quickly rose to the top of Barjatya's list, following Salman Khan’s exit. According to a report in Peeping Moon, a source revealed, “Barjatya intends to proceed with this project even after Salman Khan turned it down. He is now tweaking the script and has toned down the age of the lead character. When Salman left the movie, he immediately approached Shahid, who also played the role of ‘Prem’ in his 2006 romantic drama, Vivah. Both have met multiple times, and their conversations thus far point to the possibility of their reunion after 18 years. Barjatya is hopeful to get him on board, while Shahid has also shown his interest, but he hasn't given his final nod yet.”Meanwhile, Shahid Kapoor is working with Rosshan Andrrews on Deva along with Pooja Hegde. He is also working with Anees Bazmee on a comedy entertainer.

 SCOOP: Baba Siddiqui does it again; Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover bonded at his Iftaar Party in 2023 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 09:49:54 +0200 
 In December 2023, Netflix released a quirky video announcing a new show featuring Kapil Sharma, Sunil Grover, Archana Puran Singh and others. The video became a talking point not just for its fun quotient but also because it meant Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover reuniting after a hiatus. Both used to work together on the much-loved comic TV series ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’. In March 2017, they fought on a flight. Kapil was allegedly drunk when he hit Sunil, which led to the latter quitting the show. As a result, their reunion is significant. And Bollywood Hungama has learned that Baba Siddiqui, the politician who ended Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan’s fight, was in a way also responsible for Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover’s joint comeback.A source told Bollywood Hungama, “In 2013, history was made at Baba Siddiqui’s Iftaar party. Shah Rukh and Salman were not on talking terms for nearly five years. But on that fateful day, they came together and hugged, leading to jubilation in the industry and among fans. Ten years later, history repeated at his 2023 Iftaar party where Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover met and bonded really well. 6 months later, the announcement of their Netflix show dropped.”Interestingly, the Netflix video also hints at their mid-air fracas. Kapil Sharma tells viewers that “(Sunil and I) are going to be in more than 190 countries (through our new show).” At this, Sunil Grover, “Except for Australia,” since the flight was returning to Mumbai from Down Under when the fight occurred. Sunil even jokes, “We won’t go by air. We’ll go by road!” A similar joke is cracked by Sunil in the recently released announcement video, ‘The Great Indian Kapil Show’ of the same show.Of late, Sunil Grover has been seen in multiple projects like Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Goodbye (2022), Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan (2023) and web series like United Kacche and Sunflower. Sunflower's second season, featuring Adah Sharma, was also released recently. Kapil Sharma, meanwhile, continues with his hit TV show. Last year, he was seen in a de-glam role in Nandita Das' Zwigato (2023). He has a cameo in Crew, starring Kareena Kapoor Khan, Tabu and Kriti Sanon.Despite the 2017 fight, Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma spoke highly of each other in interviews. In an interview in 2021, Sunil Grover stated, “As far as collaborating with Kapil is concerned, why not? If I am offered a great concept, I will take it up.” He posted a sweet note when Kapil Sharma’s daughter was born.Kapil Sharma, meanwhile, said in a 2020 interview “Maine Sunil paaji se bahut cheezein seekhe hai, aur future mein, if a good project comes by, unke saath kaam karne mein bada mazaa aayega.” He also expressed concern after Sunil Grover had to undergo heart surgery in early 2022. 
 CBFC grants U/A certificate to Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan while the original version Vash was passed with an ‘A’ certificate, that too with 8 cuts 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 09:30:58 +0200 
 The Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan has been in the news ever since the makers launched the chilling trailer of the film on February 22. The advance booking opened on Sunday to a favourable response and it’s expected to fetch a good opening. On March 4, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) granted a U/A certificate to the makers. It has led to jubilation in the trade and exhibition sector as it would mean that not just adults but even family crowds can now throng theatres to see Shaitaan.Shaitaan received 4 modifications from the Examining Committee (EC) of the CBFC. The EC asked the makers to add a voiceover for the disclaimer and another disclaimer stating 'the film does not support/endorse black magic'. They also told the makers to add a static message on liquor consumption. An abusive word was replaced with a scream. The film also got a visual cut - the makers were asked to reduce visuals of blood oozing from the mouth by 25%.Shaitaan movie releases in cinemas on March 8. The length of the film, as mentioned on the censor certificate, is 132 minutes.Shaitaan movie is an official remake of the 2023 Gujarati super-hit film, Vash. Interestingly, the original film was given an adults-only certificate. A Gujarati film industry member said, “Vash was not just passed with an ‘A’ certificate, but it was also given 8 cuts. Shaitaan, on the other hand, gets U/A and also fewer cuts. Nevertheless, Vash was a super-hit but with a U/A certificate, imagine the business it could have done.”Vash suffered dialogue cuts and also the scenes of bloodshed were deleted at multiple places. In all, the CBFC asked the makers to do 8 cuts and modifications.An industry insider, however, noted, “It is possible that Shaitaan is less gory than Vash and hence, it hasn’t faced so many cuts. Only once we see the film can we make a comparison. Until then, it’s too early to conclude that the CBFC was biased towards the Bollywood remake.”Nevertheless, this comes at a time when the Gujarati industry and even Gujarati cinema moviegoers are slamming the CBFC over the treatment meted out to the recently released period film, Kasoombo. Its director Vijaygiri Bava posted a video alleging the CBFC gave unfair cuts to his film. He revealed that scenes of shlokas were asked to be removed while no cut was given to the religious scenes of Alaudin Khilji’s character. The video, in which the director also claimed that he got the certificate a day before and that he was on the verge of crying, went viral on social media.Also Read: Jyotika on returning to Bollywood after 25 years with Shaitaan: “Very strong role-wise, content-wise and as a film, I feel extremely proud of it”

 Richa Chadha, Dulquer Salmaan, Vir Das REACT to Spanish woman's gang-rape in Jharkhand: “Shame on our rotten society” 
 
 
 Mon, 04 Mar 2024 14:41:40 +0200 
 The recent gang rape incident involving a Spanish woman on a bike tour with her husband has sent shockwaves across the nation. On Friday night, the couple fell victim to a heinous crime allegedly perpetrated by seven individuals in Kurmahat village, Dumka district, Jharkhand. Reacting to this horrific incident, Bollywood actress Richa Chadha took to Instagram to express her outrage, denouncing the treatment of foreigners in India and lamenting the state of society."Shameful! Indians are treating foreigners like they treat their own women. Shame on our rotten society," Chadha wrote in her Instagram post. Joining the chorus of condemnation, actor Dulquer Salmaan expressed his distress over the incident, sharing a video made by the victim's husband on his Instagram stories. Salmaan expressed solidarity with the couple."Crushed to hear about this! You both recently visited Kottayam where close friends hosted you for a meal. This should not happen to anyone anywhere," Salmaan wrote, highlighting the gravity of the situation and the urgent need for societal change.Singer Chinmayi Sripada also weighed in on the issue, criticising the lack of empathy and accountability in Indian society. Referring to previous instances of harassment faced by foreign nationals in the country, Sripada shed light on the importance of acknowledging the problem and implementing effective measures to ensure safety for all."It is well known by now how men in India ogle at and harass foreign nationals and women. Aththi Devo Bhava and Beti Bachao are mere slogans," Sripada remarked, underscoring the gap between rhetoric and action in addressing gender-based violence.Comedian-turned-actor Vir Das also expressed his views on the matter and wrote on X, “The 7 men responsible for Jharkhand need to be found and given the strictest punishment the law can provide. A shameful act that we MUST show will not be tolerated.”This is such an uncalled for, unempathetic response to a foreign national who publishes (after adding he still loves the country) his experiences as a tourist.

 Shaitaan Box Office Estimate Day 1: Ajay Devgn's horror flick casts a spell with a stellar start; collects Rs. 14.50 crores on Day 1 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 21:58:00 +0200 
 The Ajay Devgn-led Shaitaan has taken a very good start at the box office in India as early estimates suggest an opening day in the range of Rs. 14.25 to 15.25 crores. The horror thriller has surpassed all expectations and is proving to be a surprise package as far as the theatrical run is concerned. The top 3 national chains are headed to collect Rs. 7.25 crores, contributing around 50 percent to the total business.The film has done well universally - be it the metros or the mass belts - and the early audience reports are also supremely positive. The best business of Shaitaan has come from Mumbai followed by mass centres like CI, CP, and Rajasthan. Shaitaan will be looking at an opening weekend of Rs. 55 crores, and the audience reports from the cinema hall suggest the film will have a long run at the box office.Shaitaan was looking like a weak film however, the tides changed when the makers launched the theatrical trailer two weeks before the release. Mass Maharaja, Ajay Devgn is driving the business as it has been a while seen a leading film hero featured in a film of this genre.Shaitaan is not really an adult film and the treatment of the subject makes it palatable for the family audience too and this gives a shot for the film to have better legs in the long run. The start is very good, boosted by the Maha Shivratri holiday in mass belts, and its now all on the weekend growth 
 Shaitaan becomes Ajay Devgn’s biggest overseas release; to release in 1200+ screens in over 60 countries overseas 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 21:50:32 +0200 
 It seems like Shaitaan starring Ajay Devgn is generating quite a buzz, especially with its extensive overseas release. Directed by Vikas Bahl and featuring R Madhavan in a negative role, the film is anticipated to make a significant impact in the international market. With screenings planned in over 60 countries across 950+ locations and 1200 screens, it's poised to be Ajay Devgn's biggest overseas release to date.The wide release strategy, coupled with the excitement surrounding the film and its promotional efforts, is expected to drive impressive opening day collections. Early previews in the U.S.A and G.C.C territories have already received positive feedback, further fuelling anticipation for its international debut.Presented by Jio Studios, Devgn Films, and Panorama Studios, Shaitaan is described as a supernatural-thriller. Funasia Films and Marudhar Entertainment Network are handling distribution in the overseas market. Fans can catch the film when it releases on Friday, March 8. 
 Shaitaan Box Office Prediction: Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan starrer all set for a good start 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 13:35:31 +0200 
 The month of March is all set to embark on a good start, what with Shaitaan poised to take a positive start at the box office. Horror/supernatural genre was once considered to be a safe genre with a decent to good opening always guaranteed to come in. However, over the years, hardly any films are made in this space and hence with Shaitaan coming in, it’s a welcome relief.The fact that Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan are spearheading the show makes the film even bigger because typically there are mid-level stars or newcomers on such movies. However, their presence has lent added credibility to the film and made it accessible to a much larger audience base. All of that is for nothing though if the promo doesn’t work but in case of Shaitaan, this is a positive since audience awareness is there and that should ensure that the footfalls are at least decent enough to begin with.This one is primarily a word-of-mouth affair so even Rs. 7-8 crores opening would have been a nice enough start. However, advance booking has indicated some sort of momentum already building around the film which means a Rs. 10 crores start is pretty much there for the taking and there is possibility of Rs. 12 crores mark been reached as well. Given the mid-budget set up of the Vikas Bahl film, a start in Rs. 10-12 crores will ensure that the stage is set for it to further grow well over the weekend on the basis of strong word-of-mouth. 
 Shaitaan Advance Booking Update: Ajay Devgn's horror epic sells 35,000 tickets across the National multiplex chains; gears up for Rs. 10.5 cr. opening on Day 1 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Mar 2024 09:51:45 +0200 
 The Vikas Bahl directed Shaitaan starring Ajay Devgn and R Madhavan has fetched a good response in advance booking. As on early morning on Thursday, the horror film has sold approx. 35,000 tickets across the Top 3 national multiplex chains – PVR, Inox &amp; Cinepolis. The film is looking to rake in overall pre-sales of 70,000 tickets in the national multiplex chains.The advance booking of Shaitaan will end up being 2 times higher than Devgn's last release, Bholaa, which co-incidentally again released on Maha Shivratri. Shaitaan will be looking to open at Rs. 10.50 crores on Friday, which is a good start for a horror film made on a limited budget.If the film carries positive report, Shaitaan will be looking to grow over the weekend and pack a punch. The trailer of Shaitaan was solid and the impact of the theatrical trailer is visible in pre-sales. Interestingly, the advance bookings are good in non national chains and single screens too, and this has got a lot to do with the Ajay Devgn factor.Shaitaan is all set to release on March 9, 2024. Stay tuned for Bollywood Hungama's review of this horror thriller. 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer is the top performing film on Monday 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 17:19:44 +0200 
 Amongst all the films in the running, Article 370 has emerged as the top performing of them all. Despite new releases as well as some holdover films, it’s the geopolitical action drama that’s finding the most footfalls for 11 days in a row now. The film has pretty much come on its own and for the rest of the week too, it would be bringing in the most footfalls on a daily basis.This was seen not just over the weekend gone by when the collections were quite good but now at the start of the weekdays as well, what with Rs. 2 crores* been collected at the box office. For a film of this sort of scale, size, setting and genre, such collections are good enough to keep coming on the weekdays of Week 2. In fact, as long as collections stay over Rs. 1.50 crores mark right through the weekdays, it would be good enough as the film has already recovered its cost and has been making profits with its current total standing at Rs. 56.44 crores*.Meanwhile, one waits to see how much distance Laapataa Ladies covers in days to come. Theatrically, its business is not in line with the merits and one expected Monday to see some sort of hold. That was going to be always challenging, especially since the opening weekend hadn’t seen the kind of jumps that would have got it into a comfortable spot as had happened with 12th Fail. Hence, with Monday coming to Rs. 0.35 crores and the overall collections moving to Rs. 4.10 crores, all eyes would be on the best that it can gather in its lifetime run.*Estimates. Final numbers awaitedNote: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer crosses half century, is following better trajectory than Neerja 
 
 
 Mon, 04 Mar 2024 12:37:54 +0200 
 On its release back in 2016, Sonam Kapoor starrer Neerja had collected Rs. 4.70 crores on its opening day. It grew well over the weekend to register Rs. 22.01 crores, had a strong first week that closed at Rs. 35.32 crores, and then more than doubled that number in its lifetime by closing at Rs. 75.65 crores. Now, the Yami Gautam starrer Article 370, which is also a female led geopolitical action drama, is following a somewhat better trajectory. After collecting Rs. 6.12 crores on its first day, registering a weekend of Rs. 25.45 crores and then enjoying a first week score of Rs. 38.82 crores, it is very likely heading well towards a lifetime score of Rs. 75 crores.This has been assured by yet another super solid day that it scored on Sunday when Rs. 7.25 crores came in. While Neerja had a lesser second Sunday with a score of Rs. 6.65 crores, Article 370 has gone up and will now be staying over the Rs. 2 crores mark on a daily basis. Once that happens then a Rs. 75 crores lifetime will be very much possible. Currently, the film stands at Rs. 54.44 crores.Meanwhile, Laapataa Ladies had a weekend of Rs. 4.12 crores. The film had started with Rs. 1.02 crores and then saw some growth in collections on Saturday and then Sunday. Ideally, the numbers should have kept doubling on a day-by-day basis but while that hasn't happened, one now waits to see if today the numbers turn out to be greater than Friday. If that turns out to be the case, then there may be some sort of run that the Kiran Rao directed film may have.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer stays over Rs. 3 crores mark on weekdays 
 
 
 Fri, 01 Mar 2024 12:38:33 +0200 
 Strong hold over the weekdays has allowed Article 370 to enjoy a good Week One at the box office. The film stayed over Rs. 3 crores mark right through with collections holding quite well from Rs. 3.60 crores on Monday to Rs. 3.07 crores on Thursday. This is really impressive because stability like this promises a good second week as well.By the look of things, the film should earn in the vicinity of Rs. 3 crores today as well since there is just no competition at least as yet. Laapataa Ladies has released along with half a dozen other releases but that too would start coming on its own during the rest of the weekend only. Till then, it would be Article 370 that will keep bringing in audiences and there would be good push that it will see tomorrow and day after in particular.The film has done well enough to reach Rs. 38.82 crores so far, which is a good number. That said, it hasn’t quite gone ahead and hit the roof just like The Kashmir Files or The Kerala Story had done on their release. These two films had seen exponential hike in numbers during the opening weekend itself and then got into an altogether different trajectory during the weekdays. On the contrary, Article 370 hasn’t quite seen that kind of trend but behaved more like an appreciated film that sees a regular organic trending.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sees negligible drop on Tuesday 
 
 
 Wed, 28 Feb 2024 13:13:10 +0200 
 It was a negligible drop on Tuesday for Yami Gautam starrer Article 370 as Rs. 3.55 crores came in. On Monday the film had held well at Rs. 3.60 crores and now that it has stayed around the same number all over again, it’s very good trending. This is the kind of hold which would be expected today and tomorrow as well which will allow the film to have a healthy first week score.The film benefits from the fact that it’s a largely open week ahead. On Friday arrives Laapataa Ladies and while there are half a dozen other films that will arrive as well, they will primarily see a token release. As for Laapataa Ladies, it would be a word-of-mouth film which means its collections will start gaining momentum from Saturday onwards. In the midst of this all, since Article 370 is a set film, it will benefit the most and hence momentum would be there in its favour.So far, the film had collected Rs. 32.60 crores and it should score a half century by Sunday itself. From there it should eventually cross Rs. 65 crores lifetime at the very least though as has been seen in the past, sometimes set films keep playing on and on and this is what the team of Article 370 would be hoping for.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sails through on Monday, should see minimal drops during weekdays 
 
 
 Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:16:14 +0200 
 Article 370 has sailed through well on Monday with 3.60 crores coming in. Anything over Rs. 3.50 crores would have been a good total for this controlled budgeted film and here the collections are wee bit more than that, which puts it in a comfortable state. The drop from Friday collections of Rs. 6.12 crores is also under control since the day also saw added footfalls due to Cinema Lovers Day, which gave the film the kind of push that happens on a partial holiday, and hence that needs to be taken into consideration as well.The Yami Gautam and Priyamani starrer has now reached Rs. 29.05 crores and will comfortably cross Rs. 40 crores mark by close of first week. It’s good to see the way the actress has been making a mark with her theatrical releases as well since last year she had already delivered a Rs. 100 Crore Club success with OMG 2. While one waits to see if Article 370 manages to push its way past the century mark as well, rest assured it would be a good success for sure and enjoy a long run.It’s good to see different genre of films finding audiences this year. It all started with HanuMan followed by Fighter and now Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya followed by Article 370; goes on to show that audiences are receptive to different kind of films regardless of genre, the scale at which the they have been made and whether it’s a core theatrical or ‘OTT type of film’.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources

 Article 370 Box Office: Scores a very healthy weekend, all eyes on weekday holds now 
 
 
 Mon, 26 Feb 2024 12:27:03 +0200 
 The weekend has done the job for Article 370. After a very good start that happened on Friday and subsequently huge growth on Saturday, the film came on its own on Sunday as well. The collections were rock solid at Rs. 10.25 crores and that's pretty positive for this film, which has a new director Aditya Suhas Jambhale calling the shots. Even to conceive a film with a subject like this is challenging in itself and the fact that he has actually executed it well and that too in an entertaining manner says a lot about how cinema is evolving in Bollywood.Just when it had started seeming that only hardcore massy action masala movies are working at the box office, it's heartening to see a geopolitical drama like Article 370 hit the screens and find good audience for itself. While one waits to see where does it eventually head towards, the fact remains that it's a clear success in the making and at the very least, a lifetime of over Rs. 75 crores is on the cards with possibility of a Rs. 100 Crore Club entry as well.The Yami Gautam and Priyamani starrer has already netted Rs. 25.45 crores and by the look of things, weekdays would be rather stable too. That means the first week numbers will comfortably go past the Rs. 40 crores mark and post that there would be good collections coming in weeks to come as well, since this isn't just one of those routine first weekend/first week films. Last year, Yami Gautam had scored as a lawyer with grey shades in OMG 2 and now in this rather heroic part in Article 370, she has proven her mettle all over again.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources

 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer sees huge growth on Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 25 Feb 2024 13:26:14 +0200 
 After taking a very good start on Friday when Rs. 6.12 crores came in, Article 370 came on its own on Saturday with consistent footfalls all over again. In fact, the film had played on reduced ticket rates on Friday but now on Saturday the prices have come to normal as well. This turned out to be a double whammy for the film as the collections zoomed further to Rs. 9.08 crores.Now even if the collections would have stayed at the same levels, it wouldn't have been bad since a large chunk of audience had anyways watched the film on Friday, and as a result the footfalls could have been lesser. However, none of that happened for the film since word of mouth is quite strong and as a result of that more and more people have been excited well enough to catch it in theatres. In fact, not just the class audience but even a good segment of masses is patronizing the film as well due to several fiery dialogues and clap-worthy scenes.The Yami Gautam starrer has now moved up to Rs. 15.20 crores and with further growth on the anvil today, the collections will rather comfortably go past the Rs. 25 crores milestone. That would be truly remarkable for the film since even if that would have been an entire Week One number, the controlled budgeted film would still have been rather comfortably placed.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office Estimate Day 2: Yami Gautam film jumps by 35%; collects Rs. 8 crores on Saturday 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 22:38:38 +0200 
 The Yami Gautam led Article 370 has shown a fantastic growth in collections on second day. According to early estimates, the Aditya Dhar produced political thriller is seeing a 35% jump in the business leading to box office collection of Rs. 7.75 to 8.25 crore. With this, the two-day total of Article 370 stands at Rs 14.00 crore.The Yami Gautam film has shown a spike in numbers despite overperforming on the opening day owing to the Cinema Lovers Day. This feat is a replica of film showing a spike in business after a national holiday. The two-day trend of Article 370 points to a likely stronghold in numbers on Monday.Article 370 might show another upward jump on Sunday and lock an opening weekend of Rs. 24 crore, which is a fantastic result for a film with a controlled budget and this star cast. With Fighter edging close to Rs. 200 crores in India, followed by Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya scoring Rs. 63 crores, and now Article 370, one can safely say that 2024 has started decently and its on Shaitaan, Yodha, Maidaan, and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan to continue the momentum. 
 Box Office: Good day for Bollywood as Article 370 and Crakk cross Rs. 10 crores mark on Friday, Cinema Lovers Day 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 14:53:28 +0200 
 It turned out to be a good Friday for Bollywood as over Rs. 10 crores came in. Article 370 and Crakk were the two new releases of the week and while the former took a very good opening, the latter did well as well. What further helped the collections was Cinema Lovers Day been (suddenly) declared a couple of days before releases, as a result of which the tickets were made available for a mere Rs. 99. This helped in increased footfalls, though that worked more for Crakk since it’s a massy film and hence lower ticket prices helped.As for the collections, Article 370 brought in Rs. 6.12 crores on its first day and that's a really good number considering the fact that this one is a geopolitical drama with a lot of constitutional jargon. That could well alienate a large chunk of audience but then on the flipside there is a lot for the class audience which means at the premium multiplexes with higher priced tickets, the film will come on its own from today. Since critical acclaim is high on the film and word of mouth amongst audiences really solid, expect the collections to increase over the weekend.On the other hand, Crakk is an out and out massy film and hence it made sense to entice maximum count of audiences on the first day itself, so that the word of mouth spreads fast. The film does appeal to the gentry, though its polished treatment and truly big screen appeal offers to the young generation as well, especially those who are into gaming and extreme sports. A start of Rs. 4.11 crores has been taken, which is the third best for Vidyut Jammwal after Commando 3 and Commando 2, and now it's about the kind of momentum that it picks from this point on.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Article 370 Box Office: Yami Gautam starrer earns an impressive Rs. 6.12 crores 
 
 
 Sat, 24 Feb 2024 12:54:21 +0200 
 Kashmir has been one of the favourite subjects of Bollywood films, especially the ones which deal with politics. Filmmaker Aditya Dhar’s production Article 370 is also a political drama based in the valley with a dose of action. Starring Yami Gautam Dhar in the lead, the movie looks back at the abrogation of Article 370 from the state in 2019.The film, which released yesterday on February 23, was expected to perform decently at the box office. But it has actually surpassed expectations by taking a positive opening of Rs. 6.12 crores in India. By doing this, the movie has proved all calculations and estimations wrong.One needs to note that Article 370, like many other films playing in theatres, was benefitted by the fact that it was Cinema Lovers Day yesterday, through which one could watch any movie in any theatre and at any time just for Rs. 99. So, it will be interesting to see if the film continues to earn well today (Saturday) and on Sunday. The reviews from the critics and the audience’s word-of-mouth has been positive. Hence, the movie has a good chance of continuing its momentum.Directed by Aditya Jambhale, Article 370 also stars Priyamani, Arun Govil, Kiran Karmarkar, among others.Also Read: Yami Gautam Dhar REACTS after PM Narendra Modi mentions Article 370 in his speech; actress says, “Hope that we all exceed your expectations” 
 Article 370 Box Office Estimate Day 1: Yami Gautam's film opens well; collects Rs. 5.75 crores on Friday 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 21:34:49 +0200 
 The much-spoken-about Article 370 starring Yami Gautam has taken a good start at the box office in India. As per early estimates, the Aditya Dhar production has collected in the range of Rs. 5.26 to 6.25 crores on the opening day, surpassing all the pre-release predictions.The political thriller has benefitted on account of cinema lovers day where the ticket was priced at flat Rs. 99 and the move has also resulted in a bigger sampling for the film among the audience. The initial reports are very positive and there is a bright chance for Article 370 to do what Kashmir Files and Kerala Story did in 2022 and 2023 respectively, though one needs to wait for the Saturday trend to say this with surety.The pricing goes back to Normal on Saturday and the trend from hereon will be interesting to see as Article 370 has over-indexed on Friday. If the film manages to be stable at the same levels on Saturday, it's poised for a long run at the box office and if by chance there is a jump in the biz, sky will be the limit.Article 370 is made on a controlled budget and with this start, it is sure to be a major money spinner for all the stakeholders.

Guntur Kaaram followed with a commendable ₹142 cr, a nod to the Telugu film industry's robust storytelling and fanbase.Ayalan and Captain Miller showcased Tamil cinema's stronghold with ₹63 cr. and ₹50 cr, respectively. These figures not only indicate the films' success but also hint at the audiences' appreciation for the diversity in genre and narrative these films offered. The bottom half of the top ten saw a mix of genres and languages, from the comedy-drama Naa Saami Ranga to the biographical drama Abraham Ozler, each adding to the month's box office with figures ranging from ₹29 cr. to ₹15 cr.January's box office collection is a clear indicator of the Indian audience's eclectic preferences, with their appetite for a wide range of stories being well-fed by filmmakers from across the spectrum of Indian cinema.

 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:49:04 +0200

 Box Office: Article 370, Crakk, Teri Baaton Mein Kaisa Uljha Jiya expected to bring in over Rs. 15 crores today, Cinema Lover’s Day 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:32:46 +0200 
 After National Cinema Day, looks like another big box office event would be designated for Cinema Lover’s Day. One hopes that something like this happens every year because if the response so far to the expected box office performances of today’s releases is any indication then audiences are truly embracing the big day.Article 370 and Crakk are the two new releases of today and they are set for a good to excellent start. With the ticket prices set at Rs. 99, online sales have been huge already with advance booking hitting the roof. To have more than 1 lakh tickets been sold for Article 370 and 50,000 crossing for Crakk further reflects that audiences are looking forward to some good entertainment at the big screen. Moreover, there has been genuine interest in the two films too amongst the target audience, because if that’s not the case then even Rs. 50 tickets don’t sell.As of now, the Yami Gautam starrer is comfortably placed for a Rs. 7-8 crores start and it won’t be surprising if it goes further high and even hit a double digit score. That would be a stretch given the ticket prices but then anything is possible when word of mouth catches up. On the other hand Vidyut Jammwal and Arjun Rampal starrer Crakk too is seeing a potential Rs. 4-5 crores opening day as there would be a lot which would come from the single screens and advance booking data for that is not as transparent.This isn’t all as holdover release Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is seeing rapid advance booking as well with more than 50,000 tickets been sold. For a film, which is in its third week, Friday collections are set to be greater than last Friday of Rs. 3.21 crores with possibility of a stretch towards the Rs. 5 crores mark.All in all, between the three films, Rs. 15 crores is a given and there is a chance that a few more crores get added to this number. A big day indeed for Bollywood.

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film further consolidates on Sunday 
 
 
 Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:21:43 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is turning out to be a success and there is good consolidation happening in the second week. If the first week had found itself on a good ground after growing well over the weekend and then staying consistent during the weekdays with good spike on Valentine's Day, then the second weekend has shown good trending as well with a stable Friday, fiery Saturday and now a stable Sunday.This was evidenced in good collections of Rs. 6 crores more that came in. This means the collections have almost doubled over Rs. 3 crores which had been netted on Friday, and that's really good. It also means that from this point the weekdays would be good all over again and since the film has come on its own already, around Rs. 8 crores more can be expected to be added on to its overall score so far.The Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has already netted Rs. 55.97 crores and should now reach Rs. 70 crores pretty soon. In fact, a lifetime in excess of Rs. 75 crores is a given now and considering the fact that this one is a sci-fi romcom which has been a rather unexplored subject in Bollywood, it would be a good enough total overall.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Ulja Jiya Box Office: The film grosses Rs. 100 crores worldwide 
 
 
 Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:08:49 +0200 
 The subject of debut filmmakers Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah’s Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is as unusual as its title. Bollywood is known for making love stories, since time immemorial. But the film starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon is one of the most unusual love stories as it’s between a man and a robot. As the makers are saying, it’s ‘an impossible love story.’ Hence, the subject of the film was enough for the audience to take note of it.After releasing in theatres globally on February 9, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya has now crossed Rs. 100 crores gross at the worldwide box office. The movie achieved the feat yesterday February 19. Its worldwide total currently stands at Rs. 100.66 crores.To breakdown the figure, the film’s India gross number so far is Rs. 66.63 crores. The overseas number, on the other hand, is Rs. 34.03 crores. The total comes down to Rs. 100.66 crores gross.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya also stars Dharmendra, Dimple Kapadia, Rakesh Bedi, Anubha Fatehpuria, Rajesh Kumar, among others. The movie is produced under Dinesh Vijan’s banner Maddock Studios and Jyoti Deshpande from Jio Studios.Also Read: In her tenth year in Bollywood, Kriti Sanon hits the ball out of the park with Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya; a RARE actor who proves her worth as a performer through mainstream films and who doesn’t rely on hatke, art films to do so 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film grows over Thursday on Friday 
 
 
 Sat, 17 Feb 2024 11:50:40 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya scored an even better Friday than Thursday as it started its Week 2 campaign at the box office. On Thursday, the film had netted Rs. 3 crores and now on Friday it has gone up to accumulate Rs. 3.21* crores. This is good because usually there is at least a bit of a dip that comes in but here the numbers have gone up. Agreed that there is no new major release in theatres and also there is a weekend kick-start factor that comes in. Still, any sort of growth is always welcome and this is the kind of welcome trend that helps a film.It further goes on to show that how BOGO offer had a very limited role to play in the film's run and it’s the merits that are bringing in footfalls. Otherwise with no such offer on Friday, the collections would have read relatively lower. However that has not happened and with the collections going up instead, the footfalls are even stronger now.From here, it's all about the Saturday growth now. As was seen in case of Fighter in its second week, the film had grown quite well from Friday to Saturday, and that set the momentum well enough to allow it a good second week. Now the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer should also show good growth today and it has to be seen how big does it turn out to be. Further to that there should be consolidation on Sunday which means in its overall lifetime total, the sci-fi romcom should add on well over and above Rs. 50* crores that it has collected so far.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Does quite well, reaches almost Rs. 40 crores 
 
 
 Thu, 15 Feb 2024 15:53:56 +0200 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is having a good run at the box office. After seeing an increase in numbers from Monday to Tuesday, the film came on its own on Wednesday when the collections zoomed up further. Agreed that it was Valentine’s Day but still at the end of the day it wasn’t national holiday. It was more of a celebration day amongst youth, especially couples, and still to have numbers grow massively over Tuesday was quite impressive.No wonder, with Rs. 6 crores coming in on Wednesday, the momentum is on the film’s side now. Something like this happens only when there is a national holiday like EDX. Still, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has grown and that shows that the film has been accepted by its target audience. Yes, there is a BOGO offer running alongside as well but none of that matters if a film isn’t accepted, and since there are enhanced footfalls already, it’s apparent that there is an audience for the film.The current score reads Rs. 38.97 crores for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya and to reach here in just 6 days is good because even if this had been a full week score, it would have been fine after the start of Rs. 7.02 crores that was taken. Now the film will, in fact, add onto that, which would set it up well for Week 2.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Comes close to Rs. 30 crores in its opening weekend 
 
 
 Mon, 12 Feb 2024 13:35:44 +0200 
 It has been a largely good weekend for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya as close to Rs. 30 crores have been scored. The good part is that the trending of the film has been positive and while a larger ratio of jump happened on Saturday, the fact that there has been some sort of increase in collections on Sunday as well means that there is a run that can be expected in theatres now.The film brought in Rs. 10 crores more on Sunday and that's far ahead of Rs. 7.02 crores that were collected on the day of release. This has resulted in the opening weekend standing at Rs. 26.52 crores which is far better than Zara Hatke Zara Bachke [Rs. 22.59 crores]. It had ultimately enjoyed a lifetime score of Rs. 88 crores. Now, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya would be aiming for a similar run as well, though for that the coming few days are going to be quite crucial.2024 has seen just a few releases so far and while Fighter has been the big one in January, the second biggest is Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya which promises to keep the month of February busy. There is a lot relying on the film to ensure that somehow a major chunk of the month goes by before Vidyut Jammwal's Crakk - Jeetegaa... Toh Jiyegaa along with Yami Gautam's Article 370 arrive on February 23 and then reignite spark at the box office. For that, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon needs to keep doing well and build on top of Rs. 26.52 crores that it has accumulated so far.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film gets into double digit score on Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 11 Feb 2024 13:45:55 +0200 
 It was a double-digit score for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya on Saturday as Rs. 10.50 crores came in. This was also the need of the hour since there is an open fortnight for the film and to leverage that to the maximum, a good jump in numbers on Saturday and Sunday was required. The good part is that this has come on Saturday at least with numbers jumping from Friday score of Rs. 7.02 crores, and while there would be a bit of an increment on Sunday as well, given the urban theme of the film one need to keep the expectations in check.The Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer has now reached Rs. 17.02 crores and the logical next step would be for the film to hit the Rs. 30 crores milestone before the weekend is through. Since there is Valentine's Day coming on Wednesday, it acts as a mini-holiday of sorts and hence is expected to replicate the Friday number at least. This means the film does have potential to enjoy highs at multiple occasions in the first week run and a good Sunday jump will really help its cause.Last year, producer Dinesh Vijan's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke had started with Rs. 5.49 on its first day and then had a weekend of Rs. 22.59 crores before closing its first week at Rs. 37.35 crores. Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya has already seen a better first day [Rs. 7.02 crores] and will certainly have a better weekend as well as first week. What would eventually matter is whether the lifetime score of the Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali Khan starrer [88 crores] is surpassed too in the long run by Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya and for that the first week moolah will matter.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Telugu box office collections in 2023 were the HIGHEST ever but not a single Telugu film crossed the 300 cr. mark 
 
 
 Sat, 10 Feb 2024 16:53:14 +0200 
 The Telugu film industry has been doing well for a long time but it got a boost with the success of Bahubali – The Beginning (2015). It was dubbed in Hindi and released extensively in cinemas. The experiment succeeded as the Prabhas-starrer was a big hit in the Hindi-speaking markets. It even got a great viewership on television. As a result, the craze was tremendous for the sequel, Baahubali 2 – The Conclusion (2017). It was also quite loved and for the first time, a film in Hindi crossed the Rs. 500 crore mark. Ever since, several South films have been dubbed into Hindi. Even the original Telugu language films continued to do well. Meanwhile, a perception was built that Bollywood has supposedly been boycotted while Telugu films do blockbuster business. The myth was broken last year when Hindi films did record business.In this special report, we shall take a look at the performance of the Telugu film industry in 2023. The collections in 2022 were Rs. 2,145 crores, the highest ever. The 2023 figure was even more at Rs. 2,265 crores.At the same time, however, when compared to 2022 and the performance of Hindi films in 2023, the domestic box office gross collections of Telugu films paled last year. In 2022, RRR was the biggest hit ever, collecting more than Rs. 500 crores in Telugu. The biggest Telugu grosser in 2023 was the Prabhas-starrer Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. It collected Rs. 278 crores gross. In other words, the biggest film in Telugu last year didn’t cross the Rs. 300 crore mark.This was followed by Chiranjeevi and Ravi Teja-starrer Waltair Veerayya at Rs. 181 crores and Prabhas-starrer Adipurush at Rs. 153 crores. A lot was expected from the latter due to the casting of Prabhas and since it was based on the Ramayana. It did have a huge opening but collections soon came down as the word of mouth was very poor.The fourth and fifth positions were taken by Veera Simha Reddy (Rs. 109 crores) and Bhagavanth Kesari (Rs. 101 crores). Both these films starred Nandamuri Balakrishna.Telugu Domestic Box Office Footfalls

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Box Office: Film opens on a decent note, should have a good weekend 
 
 
 Sat, 10 Feb 2024 14:36:56 +0200 
 It was a decent beginning at the box office for Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya as 7.02 crores came in. These are the kind of numbers that were expected in the first place and in that perspective, what the film has done is just apt.Of course, a double digit start would have been even better, something which used to be a norm for such kind of set up pre-pandemic. For instance, Badrinath Ki Dulhania [12.25 crores], Befikre [10.36 crores] and Half Girlfriend [10.27 crores] had opened much better and that too many years back. However, post pandemic romcoms like JugJugg Jeeyo [9.28 crores] and Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani [11.10 crores], which were set at a much bigger canvas (especially the latter) didn't really set the screens on fire on the very first day and grew on word of mouth.That's the kind of route that the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer would be looking at taking as well. Since it's an out and out urban film, the footfalls will primarily come from the multiplexes. The film benefits from the fact that it has two absolutely open weeks ahead of it and today the footfalls are already far better than yesterday already. This should set the stage for a reasonably good first weekend and from there it would be expecting good stability over the weekdays to take it through.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya likely to show 40% growth on Day 2; may end Saturday with Rs. 9-10 cr.

After a steady opening on its first day, industry analysts are predicting a significant uptick in ticket sales for the film on Day 2, with estimates suggesting a potential 40% growth.

A projected 40% growth on Day 2 could propel Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya to a commendable Rs. 9-10 crore by the end of Saturday, marking a substantial leap from its opening day figures.Several factors contribute to the anticipated surge in box office performance on Day 2. Firstly, the positive word-of-mouth generated by early viewers is expected to attract more audiences seeking an engaging cinematic experience. Additionally, the weekend factor often sees an increase in footfall as audiences have more leisure time to visit theatres. Lastly, the chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon, coupled with the film's compelling narrative and emotional depth, is likely to resonate with audiences across demographics, driving repeat viewings and bolstering box office receipts.As Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya continues its theatrical run, the momentum gained from a strong Day 2 performance bodes well for its long-term success.

 Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Advance Booking Update: Shahid, Kriti film all set to be the big Valentine’s Day attraction; sells 18,000 tickets across National multiplex chains 
 
 
 Thu, 08 Feb 2024 16:53:42 +0200 
 The Dinesh Vijan Production, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon is all set to be the big Valentine's Day attraction from the Hindi Film Industry. With less than a day left for the release, the advance booking of this robotic comedy is slowly gaining momentum in national multiplex chains. As of Thursday at 3 PM, the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon film has sold approx. 18,000 tickets across the top 3 multiplex chains - PVRInox and Cinepolis.Being an urban film catering to the multiplex audience, this is a decent response for the film and puts it on the pedestal to take a reasonable start at the box office in India. The final advance bookings by 11.59 PM on Thursday is expected to be around 30,000 tickets, which puts it in the same zone as Shehzada and Bhediya surpassing the other films in similar space like Zara Hatke Zara Bachke.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, which is a family entertainer, is expected to open at Rs. 6.50 to 7 crore in India and then grow from there on basis the word of mouth. This would be a fair start but make it very important for this robotic comedy to trend well in the long run starting with a big jump in collections on Saturday and another healthy jump on Sunday.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya is the first collaboration of Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon and is set to release on February 9, 2024. 
 Box Office Prediction: Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya to open in Rs. 5-7 crores range; to benefit from word of mouth 
 
 
 Thu, 08 Feb 2024 09:55:14 +0200 
 This Friday sees the release of Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya in theatres. The film was announced some time back and there was quite some intrigue around what would be the eventual title. Since there were hints that this one is a love story between a human and a robot, one expected something really 'hatke'. Hence, when it was eventually revealed as Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, it was rather interesting since in the current era, such kind of long titles bring back memories from the 90s when these were in vogue.Coming to the core of the film, this Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer is primarily relying upon the humor quotient, and every importantly, the music. With Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon coming together for the first time ever, the entertainment quotient had to be special and music too catchy. The promo gives a good enough indication for the former and as for the latter part, it's picking up well amongst the youngsters.The film releases at a time when audiences have been waiting for a family entertainer. It would be 15 days since the release of Fighter and while for the multiplex audiences there should be some unique proposition in the offering, for the masses it would be about catching fancy of the music and the lead pair, with the core content (love story between a human and a robot) relying upon word of mouth. As a result, the start of the film should be on a fair enough note with Rs. 5-7 crores on the cards, and post that it would be about word of mouth coming into play. 
 Two Tamil films crossed the Rs. 300 cr. mark in 2023 and 5 Tamil flicks did a business of Rs. 100 cr. plus 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 15:00:28 +0200 
 The Tamil film industry jumped back well after the pandemic, compared to the Bollywood film industry. 2022 was a great year thanks to the performance of films like Ponniyin Selvan - Part 1 and Vikram. Beast also put up huge numbers, though it underperformed later on. 2023, too, turned out to be an exceptional year for the South industry as the superstars once again pulled the audience to the cinemas.In this special report, we shall take a look at the performance of the Tamil film industry in 2023. As many as two films crossed the Rs. 300 crore mark domestically (gross). Thalapathy Vijay-starrer Leo emerged as the biggest Tamil hit of the year. In its original Tamil version, it collected a huge Rs. 328 crores gross in India. The tremendous hype, positive word of mouth, Lokesh Kanagaraj’s association as a director and of course Vijay’s starry presence all contributed to these huge numbers.This was followed by Rajinikanth’s Jailer, which collected Rs. 326 crores. The veteran star was loved in this film as a badass hero who teaches the goons a tough lesson. The hype for the film was also aided by Tamannaah Bhatia’s chartbuster song, ‘Kaavaalaa’.Thalapathy Vijay’s other film of 2023, Varisu, ended up with collections of Rs. 174 crores. Ponniyin Selvan - Part 2 took the fourth position, earning Rs. 162 crores. The period drama’s first part was released in 2022 and was the biggest Tamil hit that year, collecting Rs. 265 crores gross. The numbers of the sequel prove that it didn’t enjoy an encouraging word of mouth, compared to the first part.Ajith’s Thunivu, which incidentally clashed with Varisu, had collections amounting to Rs. 130 crores. These five Tamil films collected more than Rs. 100 crores plus in their original versions.The collections of all Tamil films domestically in 2022 were Rs. 1,724 crores, the highest ever. The 2023 figure was even more at Rs. 1,961 crores.Tamil Domestic Box Office Footfalls

 Fighter Box Office: Grows further over Saturday, stays above Rs. 10 crores mark again on Sunday 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 13:41:13 +0200 
 Fighter showed expected growth on Sunday as Rs. 11.50 crores came in. Yes, there was some sort of hope that maybe with a good push, the collections manage to hit the Rs. 10 crores mark at least once more in the film's run. It was always going to be difficult though since that Monday drop was really lethal. Still, there can always be miracles and that happened indeed for the film not just on Sunday but prior to that on Saturday as well.A double-digit score came on both the days and that has been a relief. Also, that has now pushed the film's case for an entry into the Rs. 200 Crore Club. That's what made both Tiger 3 and Dunki respectable because while the Salman Khan starrer, in fact, came close to even the Rs. 300 crores mark (and in the hindsight it all looks far better), the Shah Rukh Khan film also hit double century comfortably, and then collected some more, even though it was quite apparent that eventually even Rs. 250 crores would be a challenge for it.In case of Fighter, which is rather expensive, it would be interesting to see that how much farther than the Rs. 200 crores mark does it travel; more so since the quality of the content actually warranted that it enters the Rs. 300 Crore Club with ease. This is one of those cases when a good movie won’t reach out in an optimal way to the audiences. Currently standing at Rs. 166.50 crores, one waits to see if it somehow manages to push its way towards Rs. 225 crores lifetime.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Animal, Sam Bahadur, Dunki, Salaar effect: December 2023 was the BEST month ever for PVR Inox in the post-COVID era 
 
 
 Mon, 05 Feb 2024 10:43:59 +0200 
 A lot was expected from the Christmas 2023 releases – the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki and Prabhas-starrer Salaar. While both put up decent numbers, a lot more was expected from them. Nevertheless, the cinema exhibitors are not complaining, especially PVR Inox. It has come to light that for the largest multiplex chain, December 2023 turned out to be the best year ever in the post-Covid era.As per an article in The Economic Times dated February 1, Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, Executive Director, PVR Inox Limited, has been quoted saying that the months of October and November were muted due to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and lesser supply of films. But they had the best month ever in December once the World Cup fever ended in the second half of November.Sanjeev Bijli further said that Salman Khan’s Diwali release Tiger 3, Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal, which released on December 1, Dunki and Salaar were the highest-grossing films in the third quarter. He also added, “Even mid-budget films like Sam Bahadur and 12th Fail did very well and contributed to the overall box office.”As compared to the quarter last year, PVR Inox’s quarter jumped more than Rs. 11 times from Rs. 3.60 crores to Rs. 41.20 crores. As per The Economic Times article, this was mainly possible due to a sharp reduction in corporate tax. The corporate tax fell 78.50% - from Rs. 66.20 crores to Rs. 14.20 crores. The revenue grew from 6.40% to Rs. 1,569 crores and expenses increased from 7.8% to Rs. 1,343 crores.The story further revealed that as per the multiplex chain, the gross box office collections grew by 12% from Rs. 883 crores to Rs. 987.20 crores. In the third quarter of the previous financial year, there were 352 releases while in the current financial year’s Q3, the number of releases was just 209. It is said that the World Cup led to many makers avoiding this period.PVR Inox also made it clear that the results are not entirely comparable as both the multiplex chains were separate entities in 2022 and merged recently, on February 6, 2023.Lastly, the article informed readers that between April to December 2023, PVR opened 97 screens and shut down 62 screens. The latter happened because "(those) screens were opened 25 years ago which are in malls that have reached the end of their life cycles," said Sanjeev Kumar Bijli. Between January and March 2024, they plan to open 72 screens, of which 4 are already operational. One of the most awaited ones is the IMAX screen at Eros Cinema, Churchgate, Mumbai. 
 Fighter Box Office: Almost doubles up over Friday, has a good double digit Saturday 
 
 
 Sun, 04 Feb 2024 18:54:13 +0200 
 Fighter is now doing some good business at major multiplexes of the country. Since the film is very urban centric, the footfalls are in accordance to that as well and that was apparent on Saturday as well. Especially at IMAX and 4DX properties, which attract a far more premium crowd, the shows were showing good occupancy, though the situation was a bit divided between 3D and 2D screens. This too was primarily the scenario at key properties across the country.That said, the fact that there has been very good growth over Friday numbers goes on to show that the film hasn't been rejected per se but it's just that the target audience is now at key urban centres. Those who have watched it are liking it; it's just that the horde of mass audiences which was expected to visit it in the first place didn’t come and that’s what impacted the weekdays.No wonder, the collections which have moved from Rs. 5.50 crores on Friday to Rs. 10 crores on Saturday are good and all eyes are on how much further than Rs. 10 crores will Sunday turn out to be. For a huge jump to happen again, it's the masses which need to come in big numbers on Sunday and in case of Fighter, the patronage is primarily coming from the class segment. The total of the film has now reached Rs. 155 crores and while Rs. 175 crores will be easily crossed by the close of weekend, it would be interesting to see if Rs. 180 crores mark is somehow surpassed as well.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Hanuman (Hindi) Box Office: Is marching towards Rs. 50 crores+ lifetime, will stay below 12th Fail though 
 
 
 Sat, 03 Feb 2024 16:52:14 +0200 
 It's going to be a 50 for HanuMan [Hindi]. The film is set to score in excess of Rs. 50 crores at the box office and it's a matter of a few more days before that eventually happens. After being in theatres for three weeks, the film now stands at 48.49 crores* after its fourth Friday. Just like Fighter, it too saw a big drop on Monday when collections came down to 36 lakhs. It did recover on a day by day basis with some increments in numbers but still, at the very least a score of over 50 lakhs was expected.This did happen on fourth Friday and that has pushed the score further. Now what it needs is a good jump in numbers today, something which had happened last weekend as well when the Republic Day holiday had really pushed it ahead and then Saturday and Sunday had stayed over the Rs. 1 crore mark. That's what's expected today and tomorrow as well and if the Rs. 1 crore mark is surpassed again on both the days then it would be really good. There is a chance of that to happen since Fighter has normalized already, which means there is space available for it.At one point it seemed that the Teja Sajja film will challenge 12th Fail lifetime but then that won't happen as the eventual lifetime will still stay below the Rs. 55 crores mark. That said, director Prasanth Verma has delivered a solid hit and it's nice to see a small film come from nowhere and give the month of January something to cheer about.*Estimates. Final numbers awaitedNote: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 12th Fail completes 100 days; industry at a loss of words at its MIRACULOUS run in cinemas: “The collections usually drop after a film’s OTT release. In 12th Fail, it didn’t and it’s unprecedented. There’s no explanation for this mania” 
 
 
 Sat, 03 Feb 2024 14:24:35 +0200 
 The much-loved film 12th Fail, directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, has entered the 15th week in cinemas. Today, it completes 100 days and the manner in which it's running in cinemas is nothing short of a miracle. Believe it or not, the film continues to attract audiences in hordes in certain pockets, though it’s available on an OTT platform for more than a month. In its current work, it’s running in around 35 cinemas in Mumbai and 24 cinemas in Delhi-NCR. The show count is 4 times more than that of Ranbir Kapoor’s blockbuster, Animal.A manager from a leading multiplex chain told Bollywood Hungama, “12th Fail has grown from strength to strength. We expected that after the release of Animal, the footfalls would slide down. But that didn’t happen. Then, once Dunki and Salaar arrived and a week later, when the film premiered on Disney+ Hotstar, we were sure that it was the end of its run in cinemas. To our surprise, the film continued to get decent footfalls. Its shows rarely get cancelled due to zero audience. Log aa hi jaate hai. During weekends, we have seen near sold-out shows, that too in bigger screens.”Another staffer remarked, “12th Fail got a boost on social media once it came on OTT and memes and reels began to be made on its scenes and how amazing Shraddha (the female lead played by Medha Shankr) is. It seemed the aam junta felt motivated to catch this special film on the big screen rather than watching it at home. Otherwise, the collections usually drop drastically after a film’s OTT release. In 12th Fail, it didn’t happen and it’s unprecedented. There’s no explanation for this mania.”12th Fail collected under a crore in the 9th, 10th and 11th weeks. But in Week 12, it collected more than Rs. 1 crore, though it faced competition from Merry Christmas and Hanuman. A source said, “No one can predict whether or not it’ll do more than the previous week. There are times when multiplexes increase its shows looking at the demand and also if the new releases don’t perform as intended.”MovieTime Hub in Goregaon played 5 shows of 12th Fail in the open week of January 5-11, 2024. PVR Citi Mall in Mumbai replaced the evening show of Mohanlal-starrer Malayalam film Malaikottai Vaaliban with 12th Fail in the weekdays last week though as per sources, the former has performed decently.It now remains to be seen how long 12th Fail continues to run in cinemas. The source said, “As long as people come, multiplexes will be too happy to play the film. At this rate, we can’t rule out the possibility of it being a rare film in today’s time to complete 25 glorious weeks in cinemas.”In its 15th week, 12th Fail has seen an increase in shows. Since it completes 100 days, its tickets are priced at Rs. 100 for all shows until Thursday, February 8.12th Fail collections till date in India:Week 1: Rs. 13 crWeek 2: Rs. 14.11 crWeek 3: Rs. 8.54 crWeek 4: Rs. 6.41 crWeek 5: Rs. 6.62 crWeek 6: Rs. 2 crWeek 7: Rs. 1.50 crWeek 8: Rs. 1.50 crWeek 9: Rs. 0.50 crWeek 10: Rs. 0.35 crWeek 11: Rs. 0.65 crWeek 12: Rs. 1 crWeek 13: Rs. 0.57 crTOTAL: Rs. 56.75 crNote: All collections as per exhibition sources 
 Hollywood footfalls plummet to 4.80 cr. in 2023 in India, down from 5.10 cr. in 2022 
 
 
 Sat, 03 Feb 2024 11:00:37 +0200 
 Bollywood Hungama has recently provided data about the performance of films in India in 2023 across languages. It was observed that all the major industries like Bollywood, Tamil and Telugu had their best performance ever in terms of domestic box office gross, in 2023. Two major industries that suffered in 2023 were Hollywood and the Kannada industry. In this special report, we’ll be sharing information about the performance of Hollywood films in 2023.Hollywood films have been doing huge business since the last decade, exceeding expectations. The Marvel Cinematic Universe played a huge part in attracting moviegoers from across the country to cinemas. Avengers: Endgame (2019) unleashed a never-before-seen craze and it was the first Hollywood film to cross the Rs. 300 crore mark. In 2020 and 2021, Hollywood came to the rescue as most of our filmmakers felt that releasing films in theatres in Covid times was risky. Even in such conditions, few Hollywood films did huge business. Spider-Man – No Way Home (2021) embarked on a strong opening and ended up collecting Rs. 218.41 crores, despite the Omicron scare and 50% occupancy rule.2022 was also great as Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness and Thor: Love And Thunder got the benefit of the goodwill of Spider-Man – No Way Home and had very huge openings. Though the collections soon plummeted due to mixed word of mouth, the purpose was served. Avatar: The Way Of Water, meanwhile, was the biggest Hollywood hit of 2022, collecting a huge Rs. 378.22 crores.2023, sadly, saw no such Rs. 200 crores plus hit. The Marvel films performed underwhelmingly. There was also no spectacle like Avatar last year and this affected earnings as well as footfalls. But Oppenheimer proved to be a surprise. Despite being a film that was meant for the intelligentsia, it managed to emerge as 2023’s biggest hit. It collected Rs. 128.46 crores. This was followed by Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part One. As it collected Rs. 119.53 crores, it’s the first film of the series to cross the Rs. 100 crore mark. Fast X collected Rs. 108.83 crores. These are the only 3 films to have had a business of Rs. 100 crore. The next big grosser, John Wick: Chapter 4 collected Rs. 53.21 crores followed by Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 at Rs. 52.21 crores.The decline in box office earnings also resulted in lesser footfall. 2019 saw record footfalls at 9.70 crores. It slid down to 52 lakhs in 2020. 2021 was better at 3.28 crores. In 2022, the footfalls rose to 5.16 crores. In 2023, however, the footfalls reduced to 4.75 crores.It now remains to be seen how 2024 is for Hollywood in India and across the world. The absence of sufficient massy flicks can once again prove detrimental. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire looks the best out of the lot and has the potential to rock the show. Other potential hits include Furiosa, Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes, Ballerina, Deadpool 3 and above all, Joker: Folie à Deux. 
 Fighter Box Office: Hrithik Roshan starrer has a low extended first week 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 16:56:05 +0200 
 A well deserving film that should have actually soared quite high, Fighter has seen a low extended first week at the box office. The collections were a little short of the Rs. 150 crores mark as they stood at 148.35 crores. This is disappointing because so much more was expected out of it. In fact, these are the kind of numbers that should have actually come in the extended weekend itself but unfortunately the drop was too heavy on Monday.The collections kept seeing a bit of a drop on a day-by-day basis, though thankfully there wasn’t any more big crash. On Thursday, the film brought in 5 crores more and hopefully today too the collections will stay over the Rs. 5 crores mark. Once that happens then some sort of growth can be expected over rest of the weekend. These are the three days when, in fact, maximum moolah will come for the film since from Monday onwards the collections will get into that Rs. 2-3 crores range and post that, new films will start arriving which will curtail its run.
This is a good film that definitely deserved a better run and one can certainly expect Siddharth Anand and Hrithik Roshan to be disappointed. There was a lot that went into the making of the film and it’s a good enough entertainer as well. Unfortunately, the film didn’t reach out to the audience in a way it should have and hopefully it will eventually happen on its OTT premiere.

 Box Office 2023: Punjabi films grossed Rs. 235 crores, Marathi films grossed Rs. 201 crores, Bengali films grossed Rs. 66 crores in 2023 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 11:00:34 +0200 
 Of late, Bollywood Hungama has reported on the box-office performance of Bollywood, Hollywood, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada cinema in 2023. In this article, we shall discuss the box-office figures of Punjabi, Marathi and Bengali films in the domestic market.Punjabi films had a historic 2019 as collections went up to Rs. 249 crores, the highest ever. In 2020, the figure was a mere Rs. 19 crores while it was Rs. 91 crores in 2021. 2022 was a bit disappointing as the total collections were Rs. 147 crores.2023 figures were the second best of all time as it jumped to Rs. 235 crores. It is lesser than the 2019 numbers but the signs of improvement are there. The footfalls also grew from 1.50 crores in 2022 to 2.3 crores in 2023, which is almost at par with 2017 levels (2.3 crores). The biggest hit of the year, Carry On Jatta 3, was also the biggest Punjabi hit ever, collecting Rs. 54 crores gross. This was followed by Mastaney (Rs. 33 crores) and Kali Jotta (Rs. 21 crores).The Marathi box-office performance, meanwhile, was underwhelming. It went on a record high of Rs. 268 crores in 2022. But the figure reduced to Rs. 201 crores in 2023. Footfalls are also down from 2.60 crores in 2022 to 2 crores in 2023.2023 saw Marathi cinema delivering Baipan Bhari Deva, which exceeded all expectations. Backed by Jio Studios, this woman-centric film collected Rs. 92 crores gross in cinemas. It is also the second-biggest Marathi grosser of all time. Sadly, this was the only major blockbuster of the year. The second biggest grosser, Subhedar, collected Rs. 18 cores. Jhimma 2 collected as much as the first part - Rs. 14 crores. It suffered from mixed word of mouth and if the reports were encouraging, it had the potential to cross the Rs. 20 crores mark. What's unfortunate is that a film like Vaalvi got all-round acclaim and yet, it didn't even cross the Rs. 10 crores mark.The Bengali industry similarly saw a drop in collections - from Rs. 77 crores in 2022 to Rs. 66 crores in 2023. While the footfalls were 70 lakhs in 2022, it was 60 lakhs a year later. Chengiz, the Eid release which was also the first Bengali film to release in Hindi, was the biggest hit of 2023 followed by Raktabeej and Dawshom Awbotaar. 
 Fighter Box Office: Hrithik Roshan starrer stays at Rs. 6 crores on Wednesday 
 
 
 Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:31:23 +0200 
 After seeing a huge drop on Monday, Fighter has somehow managed to stay stable - albeit on a lower side - in days to follow. This was evidenced on Wednesday too when the collections came to Rs. 6 crores. Of course, given the credentials of the film, this isn’t the kind of number that anyone associated with it would have expected since a double-digit score was a given right till the close of extended first week. However, when Monday itself went way below the Rs. 10 crores mark, then it was all about survival with the best possible.The Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor film now stands at Rs. 143.35 crores, and the overall collections would stay a few lakhs below the Rs. 150 crores mark by close of extended first week. There would be a bit of a drop today as well and then it’s all about the kind of hold that it manages on second Friday. Post that, it will boil down to the rise in numbers over the weekend and the best that can happen is that at least on Sunday, the film reaches a double-digit score.Siddharth Anand’s first collaboration with Hrithik Roshan was Bang Bang and that film had earned Rs. 181 crores back in 2014. The first aim would be to go past that number at least on an absolute scale (since accounting for inflation and ticket prices, this number will be rather high). Due to an open week ahead, this should happen eventually, though unfortunately Rs. 200 Crores Club entry would be extremely tough.Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources 
 Box Office 2023: Cinema halls in 2023 achieved a whopping footfall of 94.30 crores with an Average Ticket Price of Rs. 130 
 
 
 Thu, 01 Feb 2024 11:00:54 +0200 
 In a recent article, we mentioned how the domestic gross box office collections in 2023 were the highest ever. For the first time, the Rs. 12,000 crore mark was breached and the total earnings from all films across languages was a huge Rs. 12,230 crores. In this special feature, we shall take a look at the domestic footfalls.As expected, the footfalls were much better than in the last three years. In 2017, for the first time, the footfalls crossed the 100 crore mark, with the final figure closing at 101 crores. The footfalls dropped slightly in 2018 to 94.50 crores. But it jumped to a record 103 crores in 2019.In 2020, the pandemic resulted in the closure of cinema halls for most parts of the year. Though theatres were allowed to resume operations from October, the fear of going to the theatres was high. This directly affected the footfalls. It plummeted to 22.50 crores. 2021 was slightly better at 42.7 crores.In 2022, theatres began operations in a full-fledged manner. The fear went away as the number of cases dropped and moviegoers were ready to go back to the theatres. As a result, the footfalls rose to 89.20 crores. And in 2023, it increased to 94.30 crores.What’s interesting to note is that it has not yet reached the 2018 levels yet but considering the situation post-pandemic, the 2023 figure is encouraging. What also needs to be considered is that though the footfalls are the third highest ever, the box-office earnings last year were the best ever. This shows that the average ticket price (ATP) also increased substantially which helped in the increase in collections.In 2023, the ATP was Rs. 130. It’s higher than the ATP in 2019, that is, Rs. 106. In the pandemic years, the ticket prices were slashed to lure the audience. The ATP in 2020 and 2021 were Rs. 91 and Rs. 87 respectively. It jumped to Rs. 119 in 2022, which was also a record high and in 2023, even this figure was breached.Even when it comes to ATP, it differs as per the language. Hollywood films are mainly targeted at the elite crowd and are also released in premium formats like IMAX, 3D, 4DX etc. As a result, the ATP for Hollywood was Rs. 237. Some of the biggest Hindi films, too, were released in these formats and its ATP was Rs. 196. In the Tamil and Telugu-speaking markets, there’s control over ticket prices and there, the audience enjoys films at reasonable prices. The ATP for Telugu and Tamil movies were Rs. 94 and Rs. 89 respectively. Malayalam movie’s ATP was lesser at Rs. 85 while for Kannada, it was more, at Rs. 103.Domestic Footfalls (in crore)

Year 2023 - 94.3 cr.Footfalls grew by 6% in 2023, but were below the pre-pandemic level (2019), indicating that the growth in Gross Box office in 2023 (15%) was driven more by an increase in Average Ticket Price (ATP) than by growth in footfallsAverage Ticket Price (in Rs.)

 After a record 2022, Kannada cinema saw a STEEP decline in box office numbers in 2023; not a SINGLE film crossed even the Rs. 70 cr. mark; footfalls down from 8.1 cr. to 3.2 cr.

 Bollywood Hungama recently provided data about the performance of films in India in 2023 across languages. It was observed that all the major industries like Bollywood, Tamil, and Telugu had their best performance ever in terms of domestic box office gross, in 2023. Two major industries that suffered in 2023 were Hollywood and the Kannada industry. In this special report, we’ll be sharing information about the performance of Kannada films in 2023.The Kannada cinema industry has been growing steadily and got a boost with the blockbuster success of KGF - Chapter 1 (2018). The sequel, KGF - Chapter 2 (2022) was an even bigger hit. Other films, too, performed well and one expected 2023 to be another stellar year. Sadly, the business dropped to alarming levels.In 2018, the domestic box-office gross collections of all Kannada films was Rs. 383 crores. It jumped to Rs. 522 crores. 2020 was bad for all industries due to Covid restrictions and Kannada was no exception. The total collections stood at a mere Rs. 41 crores. It jumped to Rs. 374 crores in 2021 and went on a record high of Rs. 810 crores in 2022.Sadly, in 2023, the business came down to Rs. 312 crores. Hence, it is less than the collections in the last 8 years, sending shockwaves into the industry.What also added to the shock that not a single Kannada film crossed the Rs. 100 crore mark. In 2022, two films entered the Rs. 100 crore club - Kantara and James. KGF - Chapter 2 even breached the Rs. 200 crore mark.But in 2023, the biggest hit was Kaatera, starring Darshan, Aradhana Ram and Jagapathi Babu. It collected Rs. 67 crores gross domestically. This was followed by Kranti at Rs. 41 crores. Kabzaa takes the third position, which collected a mere Rs. 30 crores and was a box-office disaster. Shiva Rajkumar’s Ghost collected Rs. 22 crores. Sapta Saagaradaache Ello – Side A, which got a lot of acclaim, took the fifth position as it earned Rs. 21 crores.As for the footfalls, 2019 was the best ever at 7.3 crores. The number slipped to 60 lakhs in 2020. It then jumped to 4.40 crores and 8 crores in 2021 and 2022 respectively, the latter being the highest ever. In 2023, the footfalls were a mere 3 crores.Kannada Top 5 films of 2023

 Music Review - One Night Stand 
 
 
 Thu, 14 Apr 2016 14:24:52 +0200 
 EXPECTATIONSSunny Leone's Ek Paheli Leela had good songs. Now that she is in a central role again in One Night Stand, one expects some good music on play, especially with a diverse team of composers (Tony Kakkar Meet Bros, Vivek Kar, Jeet Ganguly) and lyricists (Kumaar, Shabbir Ahmed, Manoj Muntashir) coming together. With Jasmine D'Souza making her debut as a director, one also expects some good sensibilities on display when it comes to the film and its music.MUSICThe album kick-starts on a winning note with Tony Kakkar putting together 'Do Peg Maar' with Kumaar. One Night Stand gets a cracker of a start with this foot tapping party number that has chartbuster written all over it. Oh yes, it does follow the template of 'daaru' and 'nasha'. However, for a film which is set to cater to an adult audience, this was pretty much on the cards as well. Expect this one to play on.It is time for some melody soon after with Meet Bros coming up with 'Ijazat'. A beautiful composition which has some characteristic singing by Arijit Singh, this one pretty much follows the template when it comes to the kind of love songs that are expected from T-Series in the current times. With simple lyrics by Shabbir Ahmed, 'Ijazat' moves at a slow pace with easy going music that helps it to stay on loop.What happens next is a not-so-pleasant surprise as Jasmine Sandlas croons 'Ishq Da Sutta'. Leaving aside the fact that it is in total contrast to the lovelorn mood that had been created with 'Ijazat', the composition by Meet Bros is hardly impressive while Kumaar's lyrics are way below what one expects from him. While Meet Bros. come behind the mike as well, the song can't be expected to have much of a life unless the choreography turns out to be exemplary and turns around the scene entirely.Vivek Kar and Kumaar come together for the sad song 'Ki Kara' which has Punjabi undertones to it. Crooned by Shipra Goyal, this one has Western fusion element making it sound like Punjabi pop. A situational track that typically finds its way in the second half of the film, expect this one to play in the background while the montages are on.Jeet Ganguly comes on the scene with 'Le Chala' and actually delivers the best song of the album. Sung quite effectively by Jubin Nautiyal, this one is also written quite well by Manoj Muntashir, even as the protagonist wanders in the hunt for love. Expect this one to truly go well with the film's narrative as it has the kind of depth to it that only riches the overall soundtrack of One Night Stand.The soundtrack turns further interesting with Dev Negi sung 'Tum Mere'. Poetically written by Kumaar, this one has some good music by Vivek Kar and only makes one wonder why this one hadn't come earlier in the album. Quite easy on ears, 'Tum Mere' is situational as well but manages to hold quite well. Impressive.OVERALLOne Night Stand has the kind of music that you would hear beyond just one night!OUR PICK(S)'Le Chala', 'Do Peg Maar', 'Ijazat', 'Le Chala' 
 Music review of Aamir by Joginder Tuteja 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Jun 2008 12:56:07 +0200 
 Sometimes a small film can make a huge impact. For no particular reason, somehow one feels that Aamir would be one such film. Even though the film arrives sans any media hype or promotion, there is something about this production that makes one look forward to what does the film and its music have to offer. Though one doesn't expect the film's lead Rajeev Khandewal to be dancing to the tunes created by Amit Trivedi with lyrics by Amitabh, there are expectations of a quality soundtrack in the offering which would go well as a part of the background score.Welcome to a Qawalli outing with Murtuza-Qadir, Amitabh and Amit Trivedi teaming up behind the mike for 'Ha Raham (Mehfuz)'. Instead of a conventional Qawalli with a regular sound, 'Ha Raham' indeed takes a different route. Though the essence remains just what one expects from a Qawalli, it is the serene feeling, some powerful lyrics and soulful singing which makes it a cut above the rest. One wishes the track is placed appropriately in the film's narrative for the maximum impact. 
In his next song for Aamir, Amit Trivedi takes a folk route and creates the kind of sound that one has been exposed through the band Euphoria or Kailash Kher. Amit also comes behind the mike for this fast paced number that stays attached to its ethnic route with some unconventional lyrics that make one study the song closer. It would have been interesting had a music video been created around it. Amit continues to play the twin role of composer and singer with 'Haara' and this time around he modulates his voice to go with the soft rock mood of the song. The song manages to create a haunting environment that goes well with the kind of psyche that the lead protagonist in the film is going through. There is a segregated sound in this 4:30 minutes song which doesn't follow a linear musical pattern and instead concentrates on the terrible situation that protagonist finds himself in. 'Phas Gaya (Never Mind)' is the best song of the enterprise to come after 'Ha Raham'. An innovative piece of music which has a western base to it, 'Phas Gaya' is crooned excellently by Neuman Pinto who does perfect justice to the new age sound created by Amit Trivedi. Yet again a track which takes an audience into the mind of the lead protagonist, it has a pop feel to it and is a good hear even outside the film's narrative. For the first time in the album, a female voice is heard once 'Ek Lau' begins. Shlipa Rao is the chosen one as she pairs up with Amitabh for this number that hardly has an instrument in the background for most part of its ~five minutes duration. Yet again, Amitabh spins poetry for this song which has a sad theme to it. Towards the end of the song, Amitabh makes his presence felt with his repeated rendition of 'Ek Lau Zindagi Ki Bujhi Kyon Mere Maula'. Finally comes the climax theme by Marianne D'Cruz Aiman & Jeetendra Thakur (who plays the violin). A six minute piece which has an international base to it and is paced quite slowly to bring on a haunting feel to the proceedings, the climax theme here is different from the kind that one normally associates with a Bollywood product. Truly different and spell binding, it would ensure that no one moves when it plays for the big screen. Lastly, there are bonus songs from Khuda Kay Liye ['Allah', 'Bandya O Bandya'] and Kailash Kher's 'Dilruba' and 'Chaap Tilak' which bring the album to a close. Aamir isn't a kind of album which would make much impact the music stands. However, the kind of sound it carries may work well with those who are looking for something unconventional in the offering. Amit Trivedi and Amitabh do well in sticking to the film's genre and create a soundtrack which goes well with the film's theme. 
 Music review of Naya Daur by Joginder Tuteja 
 
 
 Sat, 04 Aug 2007 12:59:37 +0200 
 "How one album has such a huge number of chartbuster tracks?" - This is the first thought that comes in mind while looking at the inlay card of Naya Daur! And this is when you also realize why lyricist Sahir, composer O.P. Nayyar and director B.R. Chopra are treated as legends!With Naya Daur, they made a film which is relevant even today while adding songs that are still loved and known by all. If in 50s, Naya Daur dealt with a battle between man and machine, 50 years down the line it is still valid as the debate has reached the next level with comparisons between machines and computers! Nevertheless, one plays on the album to revisit the classics from the era that has gone by.We just heard Pritam incorporating the 'mukhda' of 'Uden Jab Jab Zulfen Teri' in Alisha Chinoy rendered 'It's Rocking' for Kya Love Story Hai. Now revisit the classic track in it's original form with Mohd. Rafi and Asha Bhonsle coming up with an unmatchable camaraderie to create a classic. This is what you actually term as a 'feel-good' song. Rhythm, melody, pace, arrangements - just everything works in perfect harmony as O.P.Nayyar creates a tune which would be remembered for 50 more years to come.Same would hold good for ever-so-naughty 'Reshmi Salwar Kurta Jali Ka' which still continues to be a favorite. One can sense a kind of continuity from 'Uden Jab Jabâ€¦' to 'Reshmi Salwarâ€¦' when one observes the orchestra of the two tracks closely. There is a certain similarity to the earthy manner in which the songs have been composed which results in a consistent flow for the album. While Asha Bhonsle makes us believe once again that she has truly been active for more than half a decade, it is nostalgia time to hear Shamshad Begum.Now this is a kind of tune that has been replicated/duplicated/attempted by many a composers over the decades though with hardly the similar results! Composed for a situation where the lead pair of the film are professing their love for each other atop a horse cart, 'Maang Ke Saath Tumhara' is an utterly romantic number which will stay on to be a landmark song of the century gone by. Mohd. Rafi and Asha Bhosle sealed their association as a duet pair with this song which has a deadly combination of rhythm and melody to make it one of it's kinds.'Dil Leke Daga Denge' lasts merely 100 seconds which makes you wonder why the song wasn't composed as a full blown 4-5 minutes duration conventional track? For the first time in the album there comes a song which doesn't follow a happy mood and makes you feel sad along with the protagonist. Mohd. Rafi's voice makes one miss the legend once again and shows once again that how imitators have hardly managed to create a similar feel in spite of repeated attempts.It's time to get into a patriotic mode as the ever-so-popular 'Ye Desh Hai Veer Jawanon Ka' makes an entry. An extended one and a half minute 'dhol' piece at the very start restates the point that it is not just Yash Raj Films which has used this musical instrument so very effectively in the music of their films. From this point on Mohd. Rafi takes over as he sings a track which is a MUST requirement for each and every wedding celebration up North India. Even though the song is about appreciation of India and Indians, there is something about it which makes people jump on the streets and dance to it regardless of the purpose of celebration.Call it the beauty of work done by O.P. Nayyar and Sahir that in the very opening lyrics of the song it is made clear that 'Main Bambai Ka Babu' is a 'Hindustani song rendered in a Western style'! While one relishes the peppy tune, what turns out to be most remarkable is Mohd. Rafi's rendition as he gets into a completely different mood when compared to each of the other songs he has rendered so far. Sheer versatility - that's all one can exclaim for the legend.A social number, 'Saathi Haath Badhana', comes next. With the spirit of togetherness embedded in the song, 'Saathi Haath Badhana' reminds of 'Chale Chalo' from Lagaan which was based on a similar theme. Since the song doesn't belong to the romantic genre, Mohd. Rafi, Asha Bhonsle along with the chorus singers too modulate their voices accordingly to go with the theme of the song. The proceedings are much more sober and serious this time around even though O.P. Nayyar's touch is prevalent throughout the track's duration.The album ends with Rafi's solo 'Aana Hai To Aa'. A devotional track about waiting for the almighty to get things in order over the period of time, it has a strong classical base to it and deviates from the mostly feel good approach that the songs preceding it had taken. Instead the song takes the listener into a pensive mood as one looks forward to revisiting the situation in the film for which the song must have been composed.It would be irrelevant to call this piece as a review. With the songs being played on for five decades with generations before us appreciating it for it's quality, it would be sacrilege to even try finding gaps in the compositions or analyzing it as a pseudo critic. Instead, what makes sense is to simply enjoy the beauty of the tracks and talk about the overall 'experience'!Rating: Classic!

SHAITAAN is the official remake of the 2023 Gujarati film, VASH [Written and directed by Krishnadev Yagnik]. The adapted story is excellent and different from the rest of the films based on black magic. Aamil Keeyan Khan's adapted screenplay is very engaging. And it’s a feat considering the genre is beaten to death across the world and also because it’s majorly set in one mansion. Sadly, the writer doesn’t tie the loose ends properly. Aamil Keeyan Khan's dialogues are normal and very select one-liners pack a punch.Vikas Bahl's direction is first-rate. He keeps the viewers captivated in the proceedings especially once things take a turn for the worse. One feels moved by the situation of the family and one can't help but root for them. Also, the tension levels are there throughout the film and it also helps in engaging the audience.On the flipside, there are too many cinematic liberties. To see characters getting brutally injured and yet to see them not just surviving but also fighting back gets a bit too much. The climax battle seems predictable. Also, it's bewildering to know Vanraj pulling off his plan and no one getting a whiff about it. The last scene is interesting but could have been better written.SHAITAAN begins with an eerie credit animation that sets the mood. The intro shot is lovely and looks very organic. The madness begins once Vanraj innocently introduces himself to the family. Two scenes that stand out in the first half are Janvi playing violently with her brother on the swing and the police sequence. The intermission comes at a crucial juncture. In the second half, the madness continues as Vanraj ups his game while the family also tries to outsmart him. The finale keeps one at the edge of the seat, despite the shortcomings.Shaitaan Movie Performances:
SHAITAAN belongs to R Madhavan and Janki Bodiwala. R Madhavan steals the show with his venomous act. He has that innocence in him and hence, it looks believable when Kabir and his family don’t get suspicious about him initially. In the second half, he takes his act many notches higher. Janki Bodiwala gets into the skin of the character. A flawless performance, for sure. Ajay Devgn, too, puts his best foot forward and puts up a superb act. He’s sure to be greeted with claps and whistles in the climax. Jyotika lends able support and gives a natural performance. The same applies for Anngad Raaj. He’s quite funny in the initial scenes.Shaitaan Movie music and other technical aspects:
Amit Trivedi's music is okay and all the songs of the film - the title track, 'Aisa Main Shaitaan' and 'Khushiyaan Bator Lo' - are in sync with the theme. Amit Trivedi's background score is one of the USPs of the film.Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is praiseworthy, considering it's set in just one house. The camerawork in the swing sequence is exceptional. Garima Mathur's production design is appealing. Radhika Mehra's costumes are rich. Vikram Mor and R P Yadav's action is a bit disturbing but it's appropriate for the story. Sandeep Francis's editing is smooth but could have been slicker in the second half.Shaitaan Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, SHAITAAN is a nail-biting thriller laced with superlative performances and clapworthy climax that keeps you engaged. At the box office, the film is set for a good opening thanks to the well-received trailer, hype and partial holiday on account of Mahashivratri. What will also go in the film’s favour is that after a long time, an A-lister like Ajay Devgn will be seen in this genre. 
  Movie Review: DUNE: PART TWO is a big-screen spectacle 
 
 
 Thu, 29 Feb 2024 12:36:59 +0200 
 Star Cast: Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Rebecca FergusonDirection: Denis VilleneuveDune: Part Two Movie Story Review:
DUNE: PART TWO is the story of a warrior. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) defeats Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun) and gets accepted into the clan along with his pregnant mother, Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson). Some Fremen members have reservations about their entry into their clan. But Stilgar (Javier Bardem) tries to convince some of the members that he might be the Prophet who will help them defeat the Harkonnens. Paul slowly begins to learn the way of the Fremen. He and the other warriors fiercely attack Harkonnen soldiers and even their spice fields. Rabbon (Dave Bautista) tries his best but is unable to defeat them. This is when Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård) sends his fierce nephew Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) to Arrakis to teach the Fremen a lesson. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The story is fascinating and well-detailed. Denis Villeneuve and Jon Spaihts's screenplay is effective and neatly merges all the subplots together. A few dramatic scenes are very well written. However, in some scenes, the writing leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are conversational, and a few one-liners are powerful.Denis Villeneuve's direction is exemplary. He handles the grandeur beautifully and ensures that it doesn't look like similar big-scale films of recent times or even in the past. The makers take a lot of care about the character arcs and the changes they go through seem organic. A few scenes that stand out are the opening fight scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) on the desert trip together, Paul riding the sandworm, Feyd-Rautha's entry and the climax.On the flipside, the film is too long at 167 minutes. A few scenes are repetitive and hence, the impact also diminishes. The villain gets introduced in a grand fashion but in the second half, he gets a raw deal. Also, throughout the film, the powerful Harkonnens don't seem to be using all their powers to get back at Fremen.Dune: Part Two Movie Performances:
Timothée Chalamet, as expected, gives a wonderful performance but watch out for him in the second half. One has never seen him in such an avatar. Zendaya thankfully has considerable screen time, and she lights up the screen with her presence and performance. Austin Butler makes a strong impact with his performance, despite late entry. Rebecca Ferguson is a surprise as her character goes through a major change and she has done a fine job. Javier Bardem is dependable. Stellan Skarsgård is apt for the role while Dave Bautista is okay. The others who do well are Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin), Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), Christopher Walken (Emperor) and Léa Seydoux (Lady Margot Fenring).Dune: Part Two Movie music and other technical aspects:
Hans Zimmer's music, like always, enhances the impact. Greig Fraser's cinematography is top-notch. Patrice Vermette's production design is world-class. The same applies to Jacqueline West's costumes. Joe Walker's editing should have been sharper.Dune: Part Two Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, DUNE: PART TWO is a big-screen spectacle but could have had a slicker and shorter second half. At the box office, the immense hype among the urban audience can help the film become a success. 
  Movie Review: LAAPATAA LADIES works due to the plot, performances, and some scenes. 
 
 
 Wed, 28 Feb 2024 09:32:52 +0200 
 Star Cast: Sparsh Shrivastava, Nitanshi Goel, Pratibha RantaDirector: Kiran RaoSynopsis:
LAAPATAA LADIES is the story of a missing bride. On January 29, 2001, Deepak Kumar (Sparsh Shrivastava) marries Phool (Nitanshi Goel). Both board the unreserved compartment in the Belpur Katariya Express. He sits next to two other newly married couples. All the brides have covered their faces with ‘ghoonghat’. When his destination – Murti station – arrives, Deepak grabs the hand of a woman, who he believes is Phool, and gets down. He takes her to his village, Surajmukhi. His family members and neighbours are in a festive mood. But they get the shock of their lives when they open the veil and they realize that Deepak has accidentally brought another woman with him. This second bride turns out to be Pushpa Rani (Pratibha Ranta). She claims that the name of his groom is Pankaj and that she is from a village named Sambela. The next day, Deepak goes to the police station to file a complaint. The cop in charge, Shyam Manohar (Ravi Kishan), is initially amused by the goof-up. But he soon realizes that Pushpa Rani might not be as innocent as she claims. Meanwhile, Phool is stranded at Pateela railway station. Here, she befriends a tough but kind-hearted tea stall owner, Manju Maai (Chhaya Kadam), who teaches her important life lessons. What happens next forms the rest of the film.
Laapataa Ladies Movie Story Review:
Biplab Goswami's story is unconventional and amusing. Sneha Desai's screenplay adds to the entertainment quotient. At the same time, it also raises some important points. Sneha Desai's dialogues (additional dialogues by Divyanidhi Sharma) are funny and also quite sharp and hit the right chord.Kiran Rao's direction is uncomplicated and captivating. The narrative is easy to understand while the characters are straight out of life. The humour is infused in an organic manner; not a single dialogue or punch seems forced. The story could have seemed unconvincing or flawed but Kiran makes sure that it looks believable why the bride got lost and why she was not able to reunite with her hubby. As the story progresses, Kiran touches upon certain social aspects plaguing society. Yet again, it seamlessly becomes a part of the goings-on. The character of Manju Maai is a masterstroke in this regard. Kiran Rao reserves the best for the finale. It is clapworthy, to say the least.On the flipside, though the director ties all loose ends, she misses one – Pushpa’s hubby had spotted Phool at the station and ideally, he should have informed the cop about it. It would have made the investigation easier. Secondly, the angle of MLA Mani Singh is hilarious. However, it serves no purpose to the story as the MLA and his speech are forgotten. Lastly, the buzz is very limited and this can impact its box office collections.Laapataa Ladies | Official Trailer | Aamir Khan Productions Kindling Pictures Jio Studios
Laapataa Ladies Movie Performances:
LAAPATAA LADIES belongs to both the leading ladies. Nitanshi Goel’s innocence is her biggest strength and she enhances it with her supreme performance. Pratibha Ranta is quite confident and plays her part with panache. Sparsh Shrivastava, too, puts his best foot forward and gets into the skin of his character. Chhaya Kadam is terrific and delivers a National Award-worthy performance. Ravi Kishan, too, rocks the show and only, an actor of his calibre would have done justice. Rachna Gupta (Poonam; Bhabhi) and Geeta Agrawal Sharma (Yashoda; Deepak's mother) leave a mark. Satendra Soni (Chotu) and Abeer Jain (Bablu) are adorable. Bhaskar Jha (Pushpa's husband Pradeep), Daood Hussain (Gunjan), Durgesh Kumar (Dubey ji; cop) and Kanupriya Rishimum (Bela; cop) are fine.
Laapataa Ladies Movie music and other technical aspects:
Ram Sampath's music is lovely but won’t have a shelf life. 'Doubtwa' and 'Beda Paar' are quirky. 'O Sajni Re' is soulful while 'Sajni' is fair. Ram Sampath's background score is in sync with the film's mood.Vikash Nowlakha's cinematography gives the film a straight-out-of-life feel. The locales are fresh and never before seen in any film. Vikram Singh's production design is quite real. Darshan Jalan's costumes are authentic. Jabeen Merchant's editing is smooth but could have been slicker.Laapataa Ladies Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, LAAPATAA LADIES works due to the amusing plot, performances, underlying message and some memorable funny and emotional scenes. At the box office, it has the potential to grow with each passing day. 
  Movie Review: CRAKK fails to deliver the desired impact. 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:55:50 +0200 
 Star Cast: Vidyut Jammwal, Arjun Rampal, Nora Fatehi, Amy JacksonDirector: Aditya DattSynopsis:
CRAKK is the story of a reckless, brave man. Siddhart Dikshit aka Siddhu (Vidyut Jammwal) resides in Mumbai with his father (Rajendra Shisatkar) and mother (Shalaka Pawar). His elder brother Nihal (Ankit Mohan) died while participating in an extreme sports competition called Maidaan. Siddhu also likes to do risky stunts and his parents ask him not to indulge in it as they don't want him to die like his elder brother. Their plea falls on deaf ears and Siddhu sends his stunt videos to the Maidaan team. The organizer of Maidaan, Dev (Arjun Rampal), likes his videos and enlists him for the next edition. Siddhu travels to Poland illegally with the help of Dev's team. He's taken to the facility of Maidaan where he meets the rest of the 31 players. He also bumps into an influencer, Alia (Nora Fatehi), and sparks fly between them. The next day, the games begin. Siddhu manages to emerge victorious and get to the next round. The same night, Siddhu and Alia go out to celebrate. This is when Siddhu is confronted by Patricia (Amy Jackson), an Intelligence official. She asks Siddhu to spy on Dev and whether he's smuggling or transporting dangerous material with the money generated from Maidaan. Siddhu is forced to comply; or else, she would have deported him back to India for entering Poland without a valid visa. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review:
Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's story is promising. Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's screenplay, however, doesn't make the desired impact as it's stretched, silly and also delves into subplots needlessly. Aditya Datt, Rehan Khan, Sarim Momin and Mohinder Pratap Singh's dialogues are massy but a few one-liners are childish.Aditya Datt's direction is okay and it suffers as the writing is weak. On the positive, he handles the grandeur well and also the grand action set pieces. The scenes of all three races are very captivating. The intro scene is also nail-biting.On the flipside, the film's biggest issue is the length. At 156 minutes, it is too long for a film of this kind. Secondly, the film is not just about the competition. Between the three races, a lot happens and it is not exciting. It would also leave viewers scratching their heads. For instance, Siddhu badly wanted to be a part of Maidaan and earn the prize money. Hence, he had no solid reason to agree to help Patricia, especially after she let him go back to the facility. The intermission point is laughable. The track of Dev and his father Mark (Bijay Anand) isn’t effective, except for the scene where they have vodka. Siddhu spying in the facility of Dev without getting caught is unconvincing. The climax fight is tedious and the twist that occurs at this point leaves viewers frustrated instead of feeling wowed.Performances:
Vidyut Jammwal is his usual self and looks quite cool in performing the death-defying stunts. Arjun Rampal puts up a fine act but gets over the top in some scenes. Nora Fatehi oozes charm and is fair. Amy Jackson is decent but her accented Hindi looks a bit forced. Ankit Mohan delivers a confident performance. Rajendra Shisatkar, Shalaka Pawar and Bijay Anand lend able support. Jamie Lever (Junaida) leaves a huge mark. Zack (Michael Owusu) is okay. Pooja Sawant and Rukmini Maitra look sizzling in the end credit song.Music and other technical aspects:
The music is well-woven into the narrative. The title track is very catchy. 'Jeena Haraam' and 'Khayal Rakhna' are forgettable. 'Rom Rom' is played in the end credits and does register. But it looks out of place. Vikram Montrose's background score enhances excitement.Mark Hamilton's cinematography matches international standards. Federico Cueva, Kerry Gregg, Dr. K. Ravi Verma, Cyril Raffaelli, Dawid Szatarski, Raj Shinde, Sunil Rodrigues and Vikram Dahiya's action is the best part of the enterprise. Somya Chauhan, Gabriella Demetriades, Trushala Nayak and Anushka Tugnait's costumes are stylish. Juhi Talmaki's production design is functional. VFX is tacky. Sandeep Kurup's editing is loose. The film should have been shorter by 20-30 minutes.Conclusion:
On the whole, CRAKK fails to deliver the desired impact and is too lengthy. At the box office, the lack of buzz and competition from ARTICLE 370 is likely to impact its collections. 
  ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale Movie Review: ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale 
 
 
 Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:06:34 +0200 
 Star Cast: Yami Gautam Dhar, Priya Mani, Vaibhav Tatwawadi, Skand Thakur
Article 370 Movie Review: ARTICLE 370 is a gripping taleDirector: Aditya Suhas JambhaleSynopsis:
ARTICLE 370 is the story of two women who changed history. On July 8, 2016, Zooni Haksar (Yami Gautam Dhar) of the Intelligence Division finds out crucial information that a dreaded terrorist, Burhan (Shivam Khajuria), is hiding in Kokernag, Kashmir. She asks her senior, Khawar Ali (Raj Arjun), for permission but he instructs her to wait. Zooni chooses not to and executes the operation with the help of CRPF officer Yash Chauhan (Vaibhav Tatwawadi) and his team. Burhan is killed and it angers a section of political leaders. They provoke the youth, leading to violence in the Valley. The Intelligence Division suspends Zooni for not following orders. She is shifted to Delhi where she goes into depression. A year later, Rajeshwari Swaminathan (Priya Mani), of the PMO, approaches Zooni and invites her to lead a team in the National Investigative Agency (NIA) in Srinagar. Zooni accepts the offer though she makes it clear that all their efforts would not lead to any concrete result as long as Article 370 exists. The Union Government soon breaks the alliance with Parveena Andrabi (Divya Seth Shah) in Kashmir. They also impose President's Rule, thus ensuring that leaders of different political parties don't unite to form a coalition. Rajeshwari soon confesses to Zooni that the Centre plans to revoke Article 370. But they need to find a way to do so legally and at the same time, ensure that Peace is not disturbed in the Valley. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Article 370 Movie Story Review:
Aditya Dhar and Monal Thaakar's story, inspired by true events, is exciting. Everyone is aware that Article 370 was abrogated but no one knows how it was carried out. Aditya Dhar, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, Arjun Dhawan and Monal Thaakar's screenplay (additional screenplay by Aarsh Vora) is gripping. The writing becomes a bit technical in places but the writers compensate for it with some entertaining and thrilling moments. Aditya Dhar, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, Arjun Dhawan and Monal Thaakar's dialogues are powerful and clapworthy.Aditya Suhas Jambhale's direction is captivating. The film is 160 minutes long but doesn’t get boring or lengthy as a lot is happening every minute. The makers adopt a no-nonsense and realistic approach and it gives the film a nice touch. The first half doesn’t pack a punch, as intended, but post-interval, the film gets much better. The scene where Zooni interrogates Yakub Shaikh (Sumit Kaul) will be loved by the masses. The episode on how a crucial piece of information was deleted from a legal document is quite a shocker. Two tracks run simultaneously in the climax and both are entertaining and captivating.On the flipside, though the makers have tried their best to simplify the narrative, a few details might be difficult to decipher. Hence, those expecting it to be a conventional entertainer might be a bit disappointed. Secondly, in places, the film gives a feeling of being one-sided and not covering all elements of the story. For instance, Article 370 was revoked for the betterment of the people of Kashmir. However, the aam junta and their hardships are never focused in the film, except for the scene of a sarpanch (Middat Ullah Khan). Lastly, the assassination attempt in the climax is nail-biting but it also raises the question of whether it actually happened in real.Article 370 | Official Trailer | Yami Gautam Dhar, Priyamani | Jio Studios | B62 StudiosArticle 370 Movie Performances: 
Yami Gautam Dhar yet again delivers a power-packed performance. In fact, this is her most accomplished performance. She is quite convincing in the action and interrogating scenes but watch out for her in the emotional scenes. The manner in which she delivers the monologue in the first half gives goosebumps. Priya Mani keeps her act restrained, as per the character requirement and is apt for the part. Vaibhav Tatwawadi is quite likeable. Raj Arjun and Skand Thakur (Wasim Abbasi) lend able support. Sumit Kaul, Salahuddin Jalal (Raj Zutshi) and Rajiv Kumar (Shamsher Abdali) leave a huge mark. Divya Seth Shah and Irawati Harshe Mayadev (Brinda Kaul) are decent. Kiran Karmarkar (Home Minister) is superb and takes the entertainment quotient of the film many notches higher. Asit Redij (Opposition leader Rohit Thapar), too, puts his best foot forward. Arun Govil (Prime Minister) is okay and it seemed like he was trying too hard. Janya Khandpur (Sabia), Middat Ullah Khan, Mohan Agashe (Jagmohan Patil) and Ashwini Koul (Zakir Naikoo) are fair.Article 370 Movie Music and other technical aspects:
Shashwat Sachdev's music doesn't register. Ideally, ARTICLE 370 should have been a song-less film. But Shashwat Sachdev's background score is kickass and very different from the usual BGMs.Siddharth Vasani's cinematography is breathtaking and uncomplicated in action scenes. Sujeet Subhash Sawant and Sriram Kanan Iyengar's production design is rich. Veera Kapur Ee's costumes are realistic yet stylish. Parvez Shaikh's action is not gory at all. Identical Brains's VFX is acceptable. Shivkumar V Panicker's editing is smooth.Article 370 Movie Conclusion:
On the whole, ARTICLE 370 is a gripping tale that attempts to depict an important chapter of India’s history in an entertaining and simple manner. At the box office, the topic of the film and the trailer has caught attention. Moreover, the film releases on a day when tickets are available for just Rs. 99. As a result, it can open strongly and emerge successful at the box office in the long run, provided it enjoys a good word of mouth. 
  Movie Review: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE boasts of a bravura performance by Kingsley Ben Adir 
 
 
 Fri, 16 Feb 2024 17:26:45 +0200 
 Star Cast: Kingsley Ben-Adir, Lashana Lynch, Anthony WelshDirector: Reinaldo Marcus GreenSynopsis: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE is the story of a legendary artist. The year is 1976. Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir) is a successful singer and is based in Kingston, Jamaica with his family and band. This is a time when Jamaica is under a political crisis. Bob decides to have a peace concert. It leads to objections from those with ulterior motives. Bob, his wife Rita (Lashana Lynch) and brother Don (Anthony Welsh) are attacked one day at their residence. They survive but it leaves Bob shocked. He asks Rita and the children to move to his mother's place in Denver, USA while he moves to Europe. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review: Terence Winter and Frank E Flowers' story is inspiring and a tale waiting to be told. Terence Winter, Frank E Flowers, Zach Baylin and Reinaldo Marcus Green's screenplay, however, is unexciting and inconsistent. Dialogues are okay. Jamaican English is difficult to comprehend and thankfully, the studio has provided subtitles.Reinaldo Marcus Green's direction is insipid. On the positive side, the main character is fleshed out nicely. The film begins on a dramatic note and the confrontational scenes are well executed. The songs are effortlessly woven into the narrative.On the flipside, the film moves at a very slow space. Once Bob moves to Europe, the narrative loses its purpose, and you wonder where the film is heading. The flashback childhood portions further hamper the impact, except the one where Bob and his band get to record their first song. Some developments are not properly explained. One also can’t help but draw parallels with musical biopics like BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY [2018] and ELVIS [2022], which focused on the music as well as the ups and downs in the lives of the protagonists. BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE clearly failed to reach that level.Performances: BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE belongs to Kingsley Ben-Adir. The actor gets into the skin of the character and delivers a flawless performance. The film becomes watchable, thanks to him and the way he has got the nuances right. Lashana Lynch doesn't have much to do initially but later on, shines. Anthony Welsh leaves a mark. James Norton (Chris), Brian Todd Boucher (Claudie), David Marvin Kerr Jr (Junior Marvin) and Michael Gandolfini (Howard Bloom) are alright. The actors who play the kids are wasted.Music and other technical aspects: Kris Bowers's music is classic, and the film consists of some of the best tracks of Bob Marley. The ones that are well utilized in the film are 'Get Up Stand Up', 'I Shot The Sheriff', 'War', 'Exodus' and 'Redemption'. Kris Bowers's background score is subtle. Robert Elswit's cinematography is appropriate. Chris Lowe's production design is authentic. Anna B Sheppard's costumes are reminiscent of the bygone era. Action is fair. Pamela Martin's editing is painfully slow.On the whole, BOB MARLEY: ONE LOVE boasts of a bravura performance by Kingsley Ben-Adir. But due to poor execution, slow pace and negligible buzz, it will struggle to find an audience. 
  Movie Review: MADAME WEB doesn't work due to the faulty script and execution 
 
 
 Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:26:18 +0200 
 Star Cast: Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar RahimDirector: S J ClarksonSynopsis:
MADAME WEB is the story of a young woman who turns saviour for three teenage girls. In 1973, Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) heads to the Peruvian Amazon in the eighth month of her pregnancy to research spiders that have healing properties. After a lot of effort, she finds the spider. However, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), her guard, snatches away the spider from her to get powers. He also shoots Constance before fleeing. Suddenly, members of the Las Arañas tribe arrive and they try to save Constance. In the process, she delivers a baby girl and then dies. 30 years later, Constance's daughter, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is working as a paramedic in New York City. One day, she realizes that she can see the future. Meanwhile, Ezekiel is also in New York and he gets visions of being killed by three masked women. He steals surveillance technology from a National Security Agency official and uses it to find them. He realizes that the women he saw in his dreams are actually teenage girls - Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). They are not related to each other and in a strange coincidence, they happen to be at the same place. Meanwhile, Cassie also sees the future wherein Ezekiel is trying to kill the girls. She bumps into the trio and escapes with them before Ezekiel can lay his hands on them. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story Review:
Kerem Sanga, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless's story is clichéd. Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker and S J Clarkson's screenplay is engaging but is silly and will leave the audience puzzled as there are too many bewildering and confusing moments. The dialogues are ordinary and there are barely one or two memorable lines. A film like this ought to have had some funny and witty dialogues.S J Clarkson's direction is not upto the mark. It offers nothing novel and the film comes at a time when the audience is fatigued of superhero movies. The director does try to creatively depict scenes where Cassie sees the future and then goes back in time. But it doesn't make you go 'Wow' as intended. The energy in the climax scene is also off and is no way nail-biting, that it should have been.On the positive side, the scene where Cassie tries to form a bond with the girls is entertaining. The revelation about the mother in the second half is unpredictable.Performances:
Dakota Johnson genuinely tries to rise above the substandard script and gives a fine performance. Sydney Sweeney, too, puts her best forward. Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor lend able support. Tahar Rahim is over the top and is let down by the writing. Also, why on earth was he given a Spider-Man suit? Kerry Bishé, José María Yazpik (Santiago; Las Arañas tribe member) and Adam Scott (Ben Parker) leave a mark. Emma Roberts (Mary Parker) and Mike Epps (O'Neil) are okay. Zosia Mamet (Amaria; Ezekiel’s assistant) is expressionless.Music and Technical:
Johan Söderqvist's music has the typical superhero feel. Mauro Fiore's cinematography doesn't give any reason for complaint. Ethan Tobman's production design is rich while Ngila Dickson's costumes are stylish. VFX is not appealing. Action is appropriate. Leigh Folsom Boyd's editing is fair.Conclusion:
MADAME WEB doesn't work due to the faulty script and execution. At the box office, it'll have a tough time due to the negativity and poor reviews. 
  Kuch Khattaa Ho Jaay Movie Review: KUCH KHATTAA HO JAAY is a senseless saga 
 
 
 Fri, 16 Feb 2024 10:08:56 +0200 
 Star Cast: Guru Randhawa, Saiee Manjrekar, Anupam Kher, Ila ArunDirector: G AshokSynopsis:KUCH KHATTAA HO JAAY is the story of a young couple. Heer Chawla (Guru Randhawa) lives in Agra with his grandfather Brij Bhushan Chawla (Anupam Kher), elder uncle (Atul Srivastava), aunt Rajjo (Ila Arun), younger uncle (Paresh Ganatra) and an adopted brother, Chaman (Paritosh Tripathi). They own Chawla Sweets, a successful chain of sweet shops. Brij is waiting for Heer to get married and have offspring. Heer is in love with Iraa Mishra (Saiee Manjrekar). But she sees him only as a friend. Also, it's her dream to be an IAS officer and is studying day and night to clear the exams. Her mother forces her to get married as her younger sister Pallavi, who's unmarried, is expecting. Hence, her mother is in a hurry to get Pallavi married off to her boyfriend, Manoj. But since Pallavi is younger, the mother wants Iraa to marry first. Iraa shares her predicament to Heer. Heer reveals that he’s also under pressure to get hitched. He sees this as a golden chance to propose marriage to Iraa. She agrees but makes it clear that she'll clear her IAS exams and only then, will she consider being a mother. Heer agrees. After marriage, her life turns upside down in no time as the Chawlas pester her to do household as well as office work. A few months pass. One day, Heer goes to the supermarket with Rajjo. Rajjo sees Heer buying pickle and also feeling nauseous. She assumes that Rajjo is pregnant. She tells her family and they break into a celebration. Iraa tells Heer not to tell his family the truth. She realizes that knowing that she is expecting, the Chawlas won't let her do any work. Thus, she'll get all the time in the world to study. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Kuch Khattaa Ho Jaay Movie Story Review:Vijay Pal Singh's story is flawed and senseless. Raajj Salluja, Niket Pandey, Vijay Pal Singh and Shobhit Sinha's screenplay is devoid of logic and common sense. It's shocking how it even got approved. Niket Pandey and Shobhit Sinha's dialogues are nothing great. But a few liners elicit laughs.G Ashok's direction is nothing special and it's shocking that someone who made a film like BHAAGAMATHIE [2018] fail so miserably to compensate for the loopholes in the script. From the very beginning, the goings-on gets on your nerves. On one hand, the Chawla family members want to see Iraa work hard for the IAS Exams. But the very next moment, they start demanding that she should do household chores and also office work. Then the way Rajjo assumes that Iraa is pregnant, without even asking her once, will leave the audience stunned. The first half at least had some funny scenes to keep the interest going. After the intermission, the film turns serious and the twist at this hour further ruins the film. Also, in the second half, the film gets slow and hence, it'll be a pain for viewers to sit till the end.Kuch Khattaa Ho Jaay (Trailer): Guru Randhawa, Saiee Manjrekar | Anupam KherPerformances:Guru Randhawa is too raw and needs to polish his acting skills. Saiee Manjrekar is decent and pulls off her performance well. Anupam Kher is dependable, as always. Ila Arun tries her best but her character is irritating and hence, her performance also suffers. Atul Srivastava and Paresh Ganatra lend able support. Paritosh Tripathi succeeds to some extent in making viewers laugh. Brahmanandam (Dhamkeshwar) plays a hilarious character but he’s let down by the script.Music:Music doesn’t have a shelf life. 'Jeena Sikhaya', 'Jhol Jhal' and 'Iss Baar Jo Chale Gaye' get registered a bit. 'Bottley Kholo' is played during the end credits. Vijay Verma, Anamik Chauhan and Lyton's background score is in sync with the film's theme.Technical:R M Swamy's cinematography is nothing great and to show the Taj Mahal every now and then, just because the film is set in Agra, can put off viewers. Prameet Saini and Divya Gupta's costumes are rich, especially the ones worn by Saiee Manjrekar. Rahul Sharma's production design is akin to that of a TV show. Dhiraj Kumar Wadhwa's editing is nothing special.Conclusion:On the whole, KUCH KHATTAA HO JAAY is a senseless saga and will leave a very sour taste in the mouth of the moviegoers. 
  Bhakshak Movie Review: BHAKSHAK is a no-nonsense gripping investigative thriller. 
 
 
 Fri, 09 Feb 2024 16:56:08 +0200 
 BHAKSHAK is an investigative thriller. The year is 2018. Vaishali Singh (Bhumi Pednekar) is a journalist who resides in Patna with her husband Arvind (Surya Sharma). She and Bhaskar Sinha (Sanjay Mishra) run a small-time news channel called Koshish News. One day, an informer, Gupta (Durgesh Kumar), hands her a social audit report that states that the condition of the girls’ shelter home at Munawwarpur, Bihar is deplorable. It also states that the orphan girls have been physically abused in this home. The report was delivered to the government two months ago and yet, they haven't taken any action or initiated an inquiry. Vaishali and Bhaskar head to Munawwarpur and realize that the shelter home is run by the powerful politician, Bansi Sahu (Aditya Srivastava). Vaishali even meets the Child Welfare Committee official, Mithilesh (Chittaranjan Tripathy) who feigns ignorance. Meanwhile, Bansi learns that Vaishali is trying to investigate his shelter home. He calls Arvind and warns him of dire consequences if she doesn’t stop. Despite knowing the risks, Vaishali plays the news on her channel. She visits shelter homes in Patna and other towns of Bihar to get some leads. But none of the shelter homes had any young girls who had previously stayed at the Munawwarpur shelter home. Finally, she meets a prime witness. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's story, inspired by a true incident, is superb. It also works because not many are aware of this episode. Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's screenplay is captivating for most parts although the pace overall could have been quicker. Pulkit and Jyotsna Nath's dialogues pack a punch, especially the monologue of Bhumi Pednekar.Pulkit's direction is exemplary. He approaches a no-nonsense approach, and the focus of this 135-minute-long film is on the principal story. Thankfully, he doesn’t try to titillate and yet, manages to show the horrors happening in the shelter home. The plot also reminds one of the Oscar-winning film SPOTLIGHT [2015] but the dangers faced by the journalists here are grave and hence, the tension levels are quite high. The makers also raise some important issues and give a nice tribute to the unsung heroes of the media in rural India who are putting their lives at risk to break stories for the betterment of society. The film begins on a chilling note and some of the memorable scenes are Vaishali blasting her husband, Sudha’s (Tanisha Mehta) flashback and the scene at the hospital. The climax is exhilarating.On the flipside, the film moves at a slow pace. A few scenes will leave the audience bewildered like the attempt to frame Mithilesh. And though the makers try their best to justify, it’s still unconvincing that Bansi or his men didn’t try much to silence Vaishali or Bhaskar.Speaking of performances, Bhumi Pednekar delivers one of the best performances of her career. She carries the film on her shoulders strongly and understands the part correctly. Sanjay Mishra is extremely adorable, and he is also responsible for the laughs in the film. Watch out for his body language and non-verbal expressions and you realize that he’s a powerhouse of talent. Aditya Srivastava is terrific and essays the role of the antagonist with panache. Sai Tamhankar (SSP Jasmeet Gaur) leaves a huge mark but has limited screen time. Durgesh Kumar is entertaining. Surya Sharma lends able support. Gulista Alija (Baby Rani) is a talent to watch out for. The same applies to Tanisha Mehta. Chittaranjan Tripathy, Vibha Chibber (Rajni Singh), Pravin Kumar Sisodia (Brijmohan Singh), Shakti Sinha (Pappu Thekedar), Danish Iqbal (Suresh Sinha; Vaishali's brother-in-law) and Pubali Sanyal (Mamta; Suresh Singh's wife) are great.Bhakshak | Official Trailer | Bhumi Pednekar, Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava &amp; Saie TamhankarSongs are not of chartbuster variety. 'Ganga' and 'Chanda' are okay. 'Shaamil' won't have a shelf life but is played at an important juncture and is powerfully worded. Clinton Cerejo and Bianco Gomes' background score is impactful.Kumar Saurabh's cinematography is marvellous, and he makes good use of the lights and hues. Prashant Bidkar's production design is impressive, especially the shelter home. Veera Kapur Ee's costumes are non-glamorous, as per the requirement. Zubin Sheikh's editing is sharp but could have been crisper.On the whole, BHAKSHAK is a no-nonsense gripping investigative thriller and rests on the powerful performances of Bhumi Pednekar, Sanjay Mishra and Aditya Srivastava. It also gives a nice tribute to the small-town journalists who often risk their lives while trying to break stories that matter. 
  Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya Movie Review: TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA rests on the fine performances 
 
 
 Fri, 09 Feb 2024 13:05:56 +0200 
 TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA is a love story between a man and a robot. Aryan (Shahid Kapoor), based in Mumbai, is a robotics engineer at E-Robotics. His family is based in Delhi and is behind him to get married. His maternal aunt Urmila (Dimple Kapadia) is a reputed senior employee at E-Robotics and she calls Aryan to her office in the USA for a project. The day Aryan reaches the USA, Urmila flies to Belgium for urgent work. She tells Aryan that her manager, Sifra (Kriti Sanon), will take care of him. Aryan meets Sifra and sparks fly between them. They get intimate and the next day, Urmila returns. She confesses to Aryan that Sifra is a robot and that the former purposely hid this information from Aryan to check whether the latter was able to guess the truth about Sifra. Aryan is shocked and even devastated as he has fallen in love with Sifra. He cuts short his USA trip and returns to India to get away from Sifra before he falls in love with her even more. He even agrees to marry the girl of his family's choice. Unable to get Sifra out of his mind, he devises a plan. He calls Urmila and asks her to send Sifra to India as an experiment and to see how she reacts to madcap members of their family. As soon as Sifra arrives in India, he announces to his family that he's marrying her. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's story is novel. Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's screenplay is breezy but it's not consistent and is quite weak in the climax. Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's dialogues are well worded but not all jokes land well.Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah's direction is okay. They understand the grammar of family films and add the required drama, romance and emotions. The chemistry between the characters is also neatly established. The robot angle is dealt with in a simple and non-complicated manner. A few scenes stand out like Aryan apologizing to Sifra, Aryan learning that Sifra is a robot, the intermission point, Sifra downloading a corrupt software, Aryan persuading Urmila on the day of his marriage etc.On the flipside, some scenes that were meant to induce laughter like the intro scene, Aryan experimenting with a man named Dubey etc fail in their endeavour. The sequence where the men get drunk is where the makers try too hard to be funny. The chaos and madness that the makers wanted to highlight in a joint family didn’t come out as planned. The biggest issue, however, is the climax. It is abrupt and sudden and the way it unfolds will leave the audience shocked. The message is understandable but from the execution point of view, it falters miserably. The promise of a sequel fails to correct the minuses.Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya | Official Trailer | Shahid Kapoor and Kriti SanonShahid Kapoor looks super-dashing and dances like a dream. His performance is spot-on, especially his comic timing. He also excels in the emotional scenes. Kriti Sanon is adorable and gets her act right. It is not easy to portray a character that has robot-like features but can pass off as a human being and in this regard, she comes out with flying colours. She especially shines in the second half. Dharmendra has limited screen time and is cute. Dimple Kapadia leaves a mark, as expected. Ashish Verma (Monty) lends able support. Rajesh Kumar (Mama) raises a few laughs. Anubha Fatehpuria (Sharmila; Aryan's mother), Rakesh Bedi (Mama) and Grusha Kapoor (Babli Bua) don’t get much scope. Raashul Vijay Tandon (Pappu) and Brij Bhushan Shukla (Goldie; doctor) are decent. Rajan Kavatra (Inspector Gupta) and Manish Kumar (Constable Gujjar) are funny.The music is of chartbuster variety. 'Laal Peeli Akhiyaan' is foot-tapping and is well choreographed. 'Akhiyaan Gulaab' and 'Tum Se' are lovely. The title track is played during the end credits and is catchy. Sachin-Jigar's background score is in sync with the film’s theme.Laxman Utekar's cinematography is neat. Mayur Sharma's production design is rich. Sukriti Grover's costumes for Kriti Sanon and Anisha Jain's costumes for Shahid Kapoor are very stylish and appealing. Aejaz Gulab and Manohar Verma's action is not too gory. Redefine's VFX is praiseworthy. Manish Pradhan's editing could have been slicker.On the whole, TERI BAATON MEIN AISA ULJHA JIYA rests on the fine performances of Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon but suffers due to the writing and an abrupt climax. At the box office, its prospects will be limited only to a section of the multiplex going audience. 
  Argylle (English) Movie Review: ARGYLLE is a disappointing fare 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 12:48:03 +0200 
 ARGYLLE is the story of a writer being chased by a dangerous organization. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a successful spy novelist, who has written five volumes of Argylle. It's about a secret agent named Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) and his adventures. Elly's fans are stunned not just by the edge-of-the-seat narrative in her books but also by how the events depicted have later happened in real life. She gets stuck while writing the sixth part and decides to meet her parents to get fresh ideas. While she is travelling on the train, she meets a dishevelled passenger Adian (Sam Rockwell). He reveals himself to be an actual spy and that her life is in danger. She rubbishes it off but the next second, she gets attacked by goons. Adian rescues her and then explains how the happenings in her books have raised eyebrows, especially the hacker angle. He also informs her that a real-life hacker, Bakunin (Stanley Morgan), was supposed to deliver a digital file, containing important information, to Adian at Albert Memorial, London. However, he never turned up. Adian asks Elly to switch on her thinking cap and guess why Bakunin was a no-show and where he must have kept the file. The goons, who attacked Elly, belong to the ‘Division’, a criminal organization, headed by Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They also wanted to locate the file and hence, they tried to kidnap Elly. Adian’s mission is to now save Elly from the Division and retrieve the file. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Jason Fuchs's story has a novel touch and could have been made for a great spy thriller. Jason Fuchs's screenplay is promising but later, it goes all over the place. Jason Fuchs's dialogues are decent and could have been funnier.Matthew Vaughn's direction has his trademark stamp. On the positive side, the beginning portions are entertaining and fascinating, especially the chase sequence in Greece. The manner in which a docile novelist gets chased by dangerous henchmen and the bond she forms with the 'good spy' makes for a superb watch. What also adds to the novelty is Elly assuming Argylle, from her novel, is the one who's fighting, instead of Adian. Both the train sequence and the attack at the hacker's hideout keep the interest going.But then the way the film falls in the second half will leave viewers shocked. From an original, wacky entertainer, the film becomes cliched and also childish. Elly's flashback is far from convincing. The whole 'hypnosis' angle is silly and it's shocking how it got approved. The film ends with the promise of a sequel, but it won't leave the audience excited.Speaking of performances, Bryce Dallas Howard plays the lead part with conviction. Sam Rockwell, as expected, is dependable and entertaining. Samuel L Jackson (Alfred Solomon) is damn good, as always. Henry Cavill looks suave but sadly, he's hardly there. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara (Ruth; Elly's mother) are fair. Sofia Boutella (Saba Al-Badr) is wasted. The same goes for Ariana DeBose (Keira); it's sad that an actress of her calibre is given an inconsequential role. Dua Lipa (LaGrange) is rocking in a cameo. The same applies to John Cena (Wyatt).Lorne Balfe's music is typical. George Richmond's cinematography adds to the cinematic feel. Russell De Rozario and Daniel Taylor's production design is rich. Stephanie Collie's costumes are rich, especially the golden gown worn by Bryce Dallas Howard in the second half. The action is slick. VFX matches global standards. Tom Harrison-Read and Lee Smith's editing is decent though the run time of 139 minutes is too much.On the whole, ARGYLLE is a disappointing fare with a silly second half. At the box office, it has got a wide release in India. But due to negligible ticket sales and poor word of mouth, it might face a massive reduction of shows from Saturday. 
  Next Goal Wins (English) Movie Review: NEXT GOAL WINS is an entertaining flick, based on a real event 
 
 
 Fri, 02 Feb 2024 12:20:30 +0200 
 NEXT GOALS WINS is the story of a coach coaching a 'team of losers'. In 2001, American Samoa's football team suffers a humiliating defeat after they lose 31–0 to Australia. 10 years later, in 2011, a hot-headed Thomas Rongen (Michael Fassbender), is asked to join as the coach of American Samoa by the American Soccer Association. With no other option, he takes up the job reluctantly; or else, he would have got fired. His aim is to get American Samoa to perform well at the 2014 World Cup qualification, scheduled to be held three weeks later. But the American Samoa is at the bottom in the world rankings. Since its inception, it hasn't scored a single goal ever. Thomas is frustrated as he realizes that the team lacks discipline and techniques to play the game. What happens next forms the rest of the film.NEXT GOALS WINS is based on true events. The story is fascinating. Taika Waititi and Iain Morris' screenplay is simple and light. The writers pepper the film with lots of funny moments and also some touching scenes at the end. The dialogues are conversational and also hilarious.Taika Waititi's direction is neat. He keeps the focus on the story and also doesn’t go into a biopic zone of sorts, that is, the story focuses only on American Samoa’s performance in the 2011 match and how they prepped for it. Hence, the duration is kept in check at 104 minutes. The humour quotient works big time and it’s amusing to see the coach getting frustrated while trying to teach the game to the players. There’s also a lovely message towards the end.On the flipside, the makers set expectations high with the priest (Taika Waititi) assuring viewers in the beginning that they won’t be able to believe that the events, shown in the film, happened in reality. Although the event is inspiring, it’s not as unbelievable as was promised. The film stagnates in the middle and also, it reminds of films like CHAK DE INDIA [2007], JHUND [2022] etc. Lastly, it gets a very late release in India.Speaking of performances, Michael Fassbender is superb and apt for the part. Oscar Kightley (Tavita; president of Football Federation American Samoa) is adorable. Kaimana (Jaiyah) is too good as the transgender player. Her track adds a nice touch to the goings-on. David Fane (Ace; previous coach), Elisabeth Moss (Gail; Thomas' ex-wife) and Semu Filipo (Rambo; cop) leave a mark. Uli Latukefu (Nicky Salapu) is introduced in a heroic fashion but doesn't have much to do. Beulah Koale (Daru Taumua) and Ioane Goodhue (Smiley) don't get much scope.Michael Giacchino's music is appropriate. Lachlan Milne's cinematography is spectacular. The lensman captures the daily life on the island beautifully. Ra Vincent's production design is realistic. Miyako Bellizzi's costumes are authentic. Nicholas Monsour's editing is slick.On the whole, NEXT GOAL WINS is an entertaining flick, based on a real event. However, due to the delayed release in India and similarities with CHAK DE INDIA and JHUND, the film might not find many takers in India. 
  Fighter Movie Review: FIGHTER is a paisa vasool patriotic entertainer  
 
 
 Thu, 25 Jan 2024 13:39:20 +0200 
 FIGHTER is the story of a brave Air Force unit and their adventures. The year is 2019. With Pakistan intensifying operations against India, the Indian Air Force sets up a new unit called Air Dragons. It comprises Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania aka Patty (Hrithik Roshan), Squadron Leader Minal Rathore aka Minni (Deepika Padukone), Squadron Leader Sartaj Gill (Karan Singh Grover), Squadron Leader Basheer Khan (Akshay Oberoi), Sukhi (Banveen Singh) and others. It is headed by Rakesh Jai Singh aka Rocky (Anil Kapoor), who detests Patty due to a past incident. The unit members bond well and also train themselves for any eventuality. Patty and Minni get attracted to each other. On February 14, 2019, they are sent to Jammu for an operation. On the way, they come across a contingent of CRPF jawans and the Air Dragons unit briefly interacts with them. Later, the Air Dragons officers learn that those CRPF officers were killed in a suicide attack at Pulwama. India decides to fight back. Patty heads the mission and successfully destroys a militant base at Balakot in Pakistan. Pakistan is stunned by the development. This is when they are provoked into taking action by a terrorist mastermind, Azhar Akhtar (Rishabh Ravinder Sawhney). Patty fights back with his team but it has disastrous consequences. He’s also compelled to face his past demons. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Siddharth Anand and Ramon Chibb's story is a bit clichéd but is well-written and the aerial aspect gives a nice touch to the overall film. Ramon Chibb's screenplay is terrific and very engaging. The characters are well-fleshed out and also, the conflict is explained in a simple manner. The writing, however, could have been tighter. Hussain Dalal and Abbas Dalal's dialogues (additional dialogues by Biswapati Sarkar) are witty, funny and massy in some very important scenes.Siddharth Anand's direction is slick and supreme. The blockbuster filmmaker knows the pulse of the audience and also how to add scale and grandeur to a film. As a result, the film makes for an ideal big-screen experience. This was expected from him but what would surprise the audience is that this time, Siddharth delivers a mainstream film which is high on emotions. His earlier works, WAR [2019] and PATHAAN [2023], too, had some touching scenes. But in FIGHTER, he has taken this aspect to another level. And it works big time as the audience gets invested in the goings-on deeply and wants the heroes to emerge triumphant.On the flipside, there’s very little action in the first half of the post-interval portion. Also, the film gets a bit lengthy at this point. Moreover, the product placement is quite in the face. Lastly, the villain track is not convincing and is very over the top.FIGHTER doesn’t waste any time and the story moves forward from the first scene. Minni’s entry scene is great but watch out for Patty’s entry. Some might draw parallels with Hrithik’s entry shot in WAR but nevertheless, it makes an impact. The comic scenes that follow keep the interest going, especially Patty asking for Biryani in the restaurant. The Balakot air strike scene comes sooner than expected. The intermission point is nail-biting. After the interval, the emotional scenes take centre stage. The Abhijeet Rathore (Ashutosh Rana) track is a masterstroke and would be loved by the moviegoers. The tragic song also contributes to the emotional quotient. The finale is totally paisa-vasool.Fighter Official Trailer | Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone, Anil Kapoor, Siddharth AnandSpeaking of performances, Hrithik Roshan is in top form. He looks extremely dashing and plays to the gallery with his action and sarcastic and massy dialogues. But he also impresses in the scenes where he has to act vulnerable. Deepika Padukone has slightly less screen time and one wishes she had more to do. Nevertheless, her character is well thought out and the makers have delivered a solid message with her track. Performance-wise, she is terrific, as expected. Anil Kapoor performs ably and also contributes to the whistles and claps in some scenes. Akshay Oberoi and Karan Singh Grover are superb and lend able support. Rishabh Ravinder Sawhney looks menacing but he should have kept his performance in check. Ashutosh Rana rocks the show in a cameo. The same goes for Sharib Hashmi (Varthaman). Sanjeeda Sheikh (Sanchi) and Talat Aziz are decent. The others who do well are the actors playing Basheer’s father, Officer Unni, Officer Harish Nautiyal aka Nauty, Naina Jaising and Neha Joshi.Vishal-Sheykhar's music doesn’t work as intended. 'Ishq Jaisa Kuch' appears in the end credits and is picturized beautifully. But the soundtrack is forgettable. 'Sher Khul Gaye' is catchy. 'Heer Aasmani' and 'Dil Banaane Waaleya' are well-woven into the narrative. 'Mitti' is the best song of the lot. 'Bekaar Dil' is missing from the film. Sanchit Balhara And Ankit Balhara's background score has a big-screen cinematic appeal.Satchith Paulose's cinematography is quite rich. Seayoung Oh, Parvez Shaikh and Sunil Rodrigues' action is not too violent and easy to understand, despite the characters fighting from the air planes. Redefine and DNEG's VFX is top-class. Rajat Poddar's production design is superior. Shaleena Nathani, Lakshmi Lehr and Niharika Jolly's costumes are appealing. Aarif Sheikh's editing could have been tighter.On the whole, FIGHTER is a paisa-vasool patriotic entertainer that ticks all the right boxes. The film rests on Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone’s terrific performances, big-screen appeal, massy action scenes and some very strong emotional moments. At the box office, the film will start slow on Day 1 but has the potential to pick up big time and emerge as a hit. 
  Main Atal Hoon Movie Review: MAIN ATAL HOON rests on Pankaj Tripathi's outstanding performance.  
 
 
 Fri, 19 Jan 2024 12:06:11 +0200 
 MAIN ATAL HOON is the story of India's respected leader. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (Pankaj Tripathi) lives in Agra with his family. In 1938, as a school kid, he is not able to recite a poem in front of his class after he forgets the lines. This is when his father (Piyush Mishra) suggests that he should try to understand the moot point of his speech instead of rote learning. This lesson plays a huge step in Atal's rise as a great orator. He soon joins the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and becomes a close associate of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (Pramod Pathak) and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (Daya Shankar Pandey). He joins a political party, Akhil Bhartiya Jana Sangh, and even becomes a Member of Parliament in 1957. Soon, things deteriorate in the country. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay die under mysterious circumstances. Atal Bihari Vajpayee decides to take things into his hands for the sake of his country.MAIN ATAL HOON is inspired by Sarang Darshane’s Book 'Atalji: Kavihridayachye Rashtranetyachi Charitkahani'. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's story (co-written by Amol Bhor and Mayuresh Bhor) is captivating and could have made for a great biopic. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's screenplay, however, fails to do justice. The writers do not delve into the episodes and briefly touch upon them before going ahead with the story. As a result, one doesn’t feel connected with the film. Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav's dialogues are sharp but not as impactful as intended.Ravi Jadhav's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit where it's due, he has got the technical aspects right. The film has a big-screen appeal and looks grand in every way. A few scenes stand out like Atal’s love affair with Rajkumari (Ekta Kaul), Atal’s first speech in Lok Sabha and his subsequent meeting with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (Haresh Khatri), Atal forming a bond with a schoolgirl, the Pokhran test etc.On the flipside, the makers try to show too many life episodes of the former Prime Minister. While doing so, they keep jumping from one incident to another. As a result, most of the sequences don’t impress as they are not properly explained or are depicted too quickly to get registered. In some places, the narrative is also disjointed. The makers also never explain what happened to Atal’s family, why he was all alone or how Indira Gandhi got back to power in 1980.Main Atal Hoon – Trailer | Pankaj Tripathi | Ravi Jadhav | Vinod BhanushaliSpeaking of performances, Pankaj Tripathi hits the ball out of the park. This is one of his best performances and the way he has got into the skin of his character is seen to be believed. It’s thanks to him that the film is watchable. Piyush Mishra is likeable in a cameo. Ekta Kaul leaves a mark. Pramod Pathak and Daya Shankar Pandey are decent. Raja Rameshkumar Sevak (Lal Krishna Advani) does quite well, though he’s a bit over the top in a few scenes. Payal Nair (Indira Gandhi) is okay. Prasanna Ketkar (M S Gowalkar), Ajay Purkar (Hedgewar) and Haresh Khatri leave a mark. Gauri Sukhtanker (Sushma Swaraj) tries too hard.Songs are forgettable. 'Ankahaa' is a bit memorable for its picturization. The title song, 'Desh Pehle', 'Ram Dhun' and 'Hindu Tan-Man' won’t have a shelf life. Monty Sharma's background score enhances the cinematic appeal.Lawrence DCunha's cinematography is quite good. Sandeep Ravade's production design is authentic. Sachin Lovalekar's costumes are well-researched. Bunty Nagi's editing is incoherent.On the whole, MAIN ATAL HOON rests on Pankaj Tripathi’s outstanding performance. But it suffers big time due to its flawed and disjointed narrative. At the box office, due to very limited hype, it’ll face a tough time. 
  The Beekeeper (English) Movie Review: THE BEEKEEPER fails to impress. 
 
 
 Thu, 18 Jan 2024 12:01:24 +0200 
 THE BEEKEEPER is the story of a ruthless man. Adam Clay (Jason Statham) leads a quiet life as a beekeeper. His neighbour is her kind-hearted landlord, Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), a retired schoolteacher. One day, she falls for a phishing scam and is robbed of over $2 million. A majority of this money belonged to the charitable organization that she manages. She is so devastated by the turn of events that she ends her life. Adam decides to teach the scammers a lesson. He contacts the Beekeepers, a mysterious organization that he's a part of and is determined not to stop until he eliminates all the players from the bottom to the top. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Kurt Wimmer's story is clichéd. Kurt Wimmer's screenplay is arresting but since the plot is not original, it fails to overall impress. The dialogues are okay. In the absence of subtitles, it becomes difficult to decipher some of the lines.David Ayer's direction is decent. He tries his best to enhance the entertainment quotient of the film. But the biggest problem with the film is the plot and it instantly reminds one of JOHN WICK. In fact, in the scene where Wallace Westwyld (Jeremy Irons) tells Derek Danforth (Josh Hutcherson) that no one can save him from Adam, one can’t help but draw parallels with the Keanu Reeves starrer as it had a very similar sequence. The film stagnates in the middle and the track of the FBI agents is not convincing.Thankfully, the film has a few plusses. The scene where Adam sets the call centre on fire is sudden and fun. It also comes too quickly as one doesn’t expect him to reach his target so soon. The track of the US President gave some novel touch to the otherwise beaten-to-death storyline. The finale is watchable.Jason Statham, as expected, slips into the role effortlessly and looks quite cool while performing the action scenes. Josh Hutcherson is convincing as the villain. Jeremy Irons lends able support. Phylicia Rashad is lovely in a cameo. Emmy Raver-Lampman (FBI Agent Verona Parker) and Bobby Naderi (Agent Matt Wiley) are fair but are let down by the writing. Jemma Redgrave (President Danforth) is bland. Don Gilet (Deputy Director Prigg) and Taylor James (Lazarus; tough mercenary) are memorable.Dave Sardy and Jared Michael Fry's music is in sync with the narrative. Gabriel Beristain's cinematography is praiseworthy. Ben Munro's production design is top-class while Kelli Jones' costumes are authentic. The action is quite gory and disturbing. Geoffrey O'Brien's editing is sharp.On the whole, THE BEEKEEPER fails to impress as it’s too similar to JOHN WICK. 
  Merry Christmas Movie Review: MERRY CHRISTMAS is well made and laced with a fine performance. 
 
 
 Thu, 11 Jan 2024 21:31:37 +0200 
 MERRY CHRISTMAS is the story of two strangers and their unforgettable adventure. In the late 80s, Albert (Vijay Sethupathi) returns to his home in Bombay after several years on Christmas Eve. His mother passed away a year ago and he's devastated over the loss. He goes out to have a drink. At a restobar, he meets Maria (Katrina Kaif) and her mute daughter, Annie (Pari Maheshwari Sharma). Albert and Maria start talking and soon, Maria invites him home. She reveals that her husband Jerome (Luke Kenny) is cheating on her. Albert, meanwhile, opens up about his dead girlfriend Rosie (Radhika Apte). Maria puts Annie to sleep and goes out with Albert. When they return, they get the shock of their lives. And this is just the beginning of many twists and turns that await them.MERRY CHRISTMAS is based on the book 'Le Monte-Charge' by Frédéric Dard. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's story is unconventional and gripping. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's screenplay is captivating and after a point, doesn't let your attention wander even for a second. But the writing stretches at some parts. Sriram Raghavan, Arijit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey's dialogues are sharp and witty, especially the ones mouthed by Vijay Sethupathi.Sriram Raghavan's direction is bravura. The filmmaker's distinct execution style and trademark stamp are visible from start to finish, be it in the film's vintage aspects, music and of course, in the twists and turns. Also, this time he gives an out-of-the-box experience as he uses the slow burn technique. As a result, nothing shocking happens until a few minutes before the intermission. Post-interval, the film goes on a high as too many amusing and thrilling developments occur. From here on, the audience will be completely on the edge of their seats. The climax is unexpected.On the flipside, the film might test the patience of the audience in the first half, especially in the first 15 minutes. Ideally, the run time should have been two hours. The ending is a bit abrupt and it might not be acceptable to some of the moviegoers. Lastly, the film has a niche appeal and is not meant for the mass audience.Speaking of performances, it’s a Vijay Sethupathi show without a shred of doubt. The actor, with his deadpan expressions and dry sense of humour, takes the cake. Only he could have pulled this role off so smoothly. Katrina Kaif also puts her best foot forward and delivers a stupendous performance. Certain scenes were challenging but she manages to deliver a convincing act. Sanjay Kapoor (Ronnie Fernandes) is entertaining. Vinay Pathak (Paresh Kamdar) is rocking, though he has limited screen time. Tinnu Anand (Albert’s uncle) and Pratima Kannan (Lakshmi; cop) leave a huge mark. Ashwini Kalsekar (Scarlett) is there for just a scene and is memorable. Pari Maheshwari Sharma is cute. Luke Kenny and Radhika Apte are fair in cameo appearances.Merry Christmas – Hindi Trailer | Vijay Sethupathi | Katrina Kaif | Sriram Raghavan | Ramesh TauraniPritam's music is well-woven into the narrative. The title track and 'Raat Akeli Thi' are the best of the lot. 'Nazar Teri' and 'Dil Ki Mez Pe' are just okay. Daniel B George's background score enhances the impact, especially in the climax.Madhu Neelakandan's cinematography is topnotch. Mayur Sharma's production design is realistic yet appealing. The same applies to Anaita Shroff Adajania and Sabina Halder's costumes. Hira Yadav and Sunil Rodrigues' action is devoid of gore and is minimal. Pooja Ladha Surti's editing could have been sharper.On the whole, MERRY CHRISTMAS is a well-made thriller and is laced with a fine performance by Vijay Sethupathi. At the box office, it’ll need a strong word of mouth to succeed as it appeals only to the multiplex audience in the urban areas. 
  Kho Gaye Hum Kahan Movie Review: KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s strength lies in its performances, memorable moments and depiction. 
 
 
 Tue, 26 Dec 2023 13:30:52 +0200 
 KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN is the story of three friends. Imaad Ali (Siddhant Chaturvedi) is a stand-up comic with a dark past. He lives in Mumbai with his close friend, Ahana Singh (Ananya Panday), an MBA graduate and a working professional. Both are best friends with Neil Pereira (Adarsh Gourav), a gym trainer. Ahana is dating Rohan Bhatia (Rohan Gurbaxani) since three years. She wants to marry him but Rohan is not ready and he decides to take a break from the relationship. A distraught Ahana tries her best to get back to Rohan. When nothing works, she decides to resort to social media. Neil is having a fling with Lala (Anya Singh), an attractive fashion influencer. Neil is serious about her but she doesn’t want the world to know that they are seeing each other. Imaad, meanwhile, is a serial dating addict with commitment issues. He meets Simran Kohli (Kalki Koechlin), who’s older than her. Yet, both connect and get serious about each other. Meanwhile, Neil dreams of owning a premium gym where he’ll train only 10 members at a time so that they can be given adequate attention which might not be available in other fitness centres. Ahana loves the idea and offers to quit her job and help him in setting up his dream project. Imaad, who’s stinking rich, agrees to invest. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Zoya Akhtar, Arjun Varain Singh and Reema Kagti's story is relatable and relevant for today’s times. Zoya Akhtar, Arjun Varain Singh and Reema Kagti's screenplay is breezy and uncomplicated. Apart from the relatable aspects, what also touches viewers is how the life of the trio has been depicted. A few moments stand out. At the same time, the writing gets too stretched. Yash Sahai's dialogues are riddled with today’s lingo and again, have a relatable quality. Sapan Verma's dialogues for stand-up comedy scenes are hilarious.Arjun Varain Singh's direction is neat. He ensures that one can connect with the goings-on, especially the urban youth. The issues, happiness, achievements etc. of the characters are a reflection of the lives many are living today. The social media angle also gives a nice touch. Arjun touches upon ghosting, the fake life of influencers, difficulties faced by people in staying away from their phones, using social media to get validation and even stalking ex-partners, bullying on social media etc. Some scenes that are well executed are Imaad and Simran’s first meet, Lala’s birthday bash, the epic showdown between Imaad and Neil etc. But it’s the song 'Ishq Nachaawe' which shows Arjun’s real strength as a storyteller. The finale is sweet.On the flipside, there are times in the film where nothing much is happening. Hence, this 134-minute-long film could have been edited by 20 minutes. The track of Neil in the end will leave the audience divided. The turn of events is difficult to digest and also how he comes out of it is not convincing. This track is also left abrupt, which is strange since all the other tracks are nicely summed up in the end credits song. Lastly, the issues and lifestyle shown in the film is too urban and a big chunk of the audience won’t be able to relate.Siddhant Chaturvedi delivers yet another commendable performance after GULLY BOY [2019] and proves why he’s an actor with immense potential. His comic timing is spot on but watch out for him in the emotional sequences. Ananya Panday, too, is a revelation with this film and perhaps, this is her best act. She performs with ease and looks natural. Adarsh Gourav is too good, as expected, and depicts the complexities of his part with utmost conviction. Kalki Koechlin is likeable and apt for the role. Anya Singh is convincing as an influencer who can go to any lengths for fame. She is a bit over the top but that was necessary. Vijay Maurya (Malcolm; Neil's father), Rahul Vohra (Aamir; Imaad's father) and Narendra Jetley (Paresh Phadnis; creepy neighbour) leave a mark. Rohan Gurbaxani, Divya Jagdale (Sally; Neil's mother), Garima Yagnik (Meher; Ahana's work colleague), Kashyap Kapoor (Melbun; Imaad's manager), Mahathi Ramesh (Aisha) and Roshmin Mehandru (Harsh; Malaika's primary trainer) are fair. Malaika Arora Khan is sizzling in a cameo.KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s soundtrack also has a niche feel, just like the film. 'Ishq Nachaawe' stands out due to the tune, singing and picturization. 'Hone Do Jo Hota Hai' and the title track come next. 'I Wanna See You Dance', 'Teri Yeh Baatein' and 'Baahon Mein Teri' are okay. Sid Shirodkar's background score is appropriate.Tanay Satam's cinematography is first-class and has a bit of a noir touch. Sally White's production design is superior. Bridget Baker's costumes are glamorous and stylish. Nitin Baid's editing could have been slicker.On the whole, KHO GAYE HUM KAHAN’s strength lies in its performances, memorable moments and most importantly, depiction of the reality of today's social media era. The target audience, that is the urban youth, is sure to lap up the film. 
  Salaar Movie Review: CEASEFIRE boasts of moments that will be loved by the masses. 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Dec 2023 13:46:50 +0200 
 SALAAR: PART 1 – CEASEFIRE is the story of a fearless man. The year is 2017. Aadhya (Shruti Haasan) arrives on a fake passport in India after hiding in the USA for almost 7 years. Aadhya keeps her father Krishnakant in the dark about her decision to land in Varanasi. Krishnakant’s enemies, however, get to know and they station their men outside Varanasi airport. They attempt to kidnap Adhya; on the other hand, Krishnakant asks Bilal (Mime Gopi) for help. Bilal smartly gets Adhya out of their clutches and takes her to Tinsukia, Assam. Here, he tells Deva (Prabhas) to take care of her. Prabhas’ mother (Easwari Rao), a strict headmaster of a school, has no idea about the danger to Adhya’s life. The mother employs Adhya as an English teacher in her school. Sadly, the plan is foiled as Krishnakant’s enemies find out about Adhya’s location. Meanwhile, from Kandla Port, a consignment with a prestigious seal is on its way to Burma. The men are told to go via Tinsukia and kidnap Aadhya. They do so but the truck is forced to stop as Deva attacks the team while trying to save Aadhya. However, it’s forbidden to stop the truck with the seal as it belongs to Khansaar, an autonomous, lawless territory. Vardharaja (Prithviraj Sukumaran) of Khansaar is informed about this fiasco and that his childhood friend Deva is the one who committed the ‘crime’. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Prashanth Neel's story is detailed and quite imaginative. At the same time, the mass moments are well taken care of. Prashanth Neel's screenplay is massy and entertaining. He uses the KGF template to heighten the tension and commercial moments to give the audience their money’s worth. However, there are far too many characters in Khansaar and it’s sure to confuse viewers. Dr Suri, Riya Mukherjee and Maneesh's Hindi dialogues are sharp.Prashanth Neel's direction is exemplary. To give credit where it’s due, he has riddled the film with interesting characters and a fascinating lawless world. The depiction is superb and fit for a big-screen experience. His USP is that he adds to the scene by having parallel sequences which are as tension-filled as the principal sequence. The way he switches between the two sequences while establishing a common factor between them is seen to be believed. He also smartly doesn’t let Deva attack initially so that when he does, the impact is manifold. This happens in the second half as well, where the audience will go in a frenzy.On the flipside, the biggest issue is that it’s extremely complicated. Apart from too many players in Khansaar, they have their politics and many of them are related to each other. The audience will find it difficult to get the hang of the complete picture and also the conflict. In fact, the whole ‘Ceasefire’ track is not easy to decipher. The twist in the climax is intended to amaze the audience and that doesn’t happen. Also, the pace is slow and the scenes of suffering go on and on. This formula worked well in KGF - CHAPTER 1 [2018] but here, the impact is limited.Speaking of performances, Prabhas could have done better but his performance is much better than his works in ADIPURUSH [2023], RADHE SHYAM [2022], SAAHO [2018] etc. He looks at ease in doing action and his starry screen presence is enough for the mass audience to root for him. Prithviraj Sukumaran has a late entry but rocks the show. Shruti Haasan is hardly there and is just fine. Easwari Rao leaves a mark. Mime Gopi and the actor playing Krishnkant are quite good. Jagapathi Babu (Raja Mannar), Sriya Reddy (Radha Rama Mannar), Ramachandra Raju (Rudra) and Tinnu Anand (Gaikwad) deliver fine performances. John Vijay (Ranga) hams. The actors playing Selfie, Vishnu and Bharwa are okay.Ravi Basrur's music is soulful but both the songs 'Sooraj Hi Chhaon Banke' and 'Qisson Mein' won’t have a shelf life. Ravi Basrur's background score is not too loud and works.Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is first-rate. Anbariv's action is very violent and disturbing. T L Venkatachalapathi's production design is well researched. Thota Vijay Bhaskar's costumes are stylish. Prime Focus's VFX is top-class. Ujwal Kulkarni's editing is stylish and could have been sharper as the film drags in certain places.On the whole, SALAAR: PART 1 – CEASEFIRE boasts of whistle-worthy moments that will be loved by the masses. However, the excessive violence, a needlessly complicated second half and a limited showcasing due to DUNKI will affect its box office prospects to an extent. 
  Dunki Movie Review: DUNKI bears the Rajkumar Hirani stamp of filmmaking with the right message and emotions. 
 
 
 Thu, 21 Dec 2023 13:59:21 +0200 
 DUNKI is the story of four youths trying to fly abroad for a better life. The year is 1995. Army officer Hardayal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) arrives in Laltu, Punjab to meet Mahendar, who saved his life. He reaches his house and finds out that Mahendar is no more.  Mahendar lost a golden opportunity in sports while trying to save Hardy and then passed away in an accident. Hardy takes it upon himself to help Mahendar's family. Mahendar's sister Manu (Taapsee Pannu) asks Hardy to help her with wrestling. This is because she wants to go to the UK to earn and win back her house that her father had lost due to non-payment of a loan. An agent has assured her that she can be sent on a sports visa and hence, she wants to learn the basic techniques of a sport. Hardy teaches her wrestling. However, the agent usurps money from Manu, Balli Kakkad (Anil Grover), Buggu Lakhanpal (Vikram Kochhar), and others and runs away. With no other option, Manu, Balli, and Buggu approach Geetu Gulati (Boman Irani) for help. He runs an English-speaking institute and promises to help those trying to clear their IELTS exam. The trio along with Hardy enroll in his classes. Here, they meet Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal), and all five become close friends. They aim to reach the UK by hook or by crook. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani and Kanika Dhilon's story is superb and very relatable, especially for those from the South Asian diaspora. Many people from this belt have faced issues with immigration and hence, they’ll connect with the plot. Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani, and Kanika Dhilon's screenplay is a mixed bag. While some moments are emotional and hilarious, the script overall could have been much better, especially when it's penned by Abhijat and Rajkumar. Abhijat Joshi, Rajkumar Hirani and Kanika Dhilon's dialogues are witty at places but again, going by their previous work, the one-liners should have had far more punch.Rajkumar Hirani's direction is simplistic. As always, he uses his laugh-cry-drama formula successfully. Hence, the film doesn’t ever get slow or boring. There’s no dull moment. The film starts in the present day and the way the dynamics are shown, one gets curious to know what must have happened with the characters. It also gives a déjà vu of the beginning of 3 IDIOTS [2009]. The scenes where Hardy and his team try to learn English and their visa interviews are worth watching. The intermission point is quite strong. In the second half, the scenes of Hardy in the UK court and the whole Saudi Arabia sequence turn out to be the best parts of the film. The ending is moving, and the stats mentioned are quite hard-hitting and depressing. Thankfully, the final scene is funny, and the film ends on a lighter note.On the flipside, the writing is not up to the mark. The makers haven’t focused on the families and their sufferings. Viewers should feel that the characters had a strong reason to move to the UK. But this aspect was not properly touched upon. Secondly, the humorous scenes in the first half don’t bring the house down. The same applies to Manu’s fake marriage episode. And this was necessary as all previous works of Rajkumar Hirani wowed the audience. As a result, one can’t help but expect tremendously from his films. DUNKI is nowhere close to MUNNA BHAI, 3 IDIOTS, PK, etc, and hence, audiences will feel a bit dejected, despite the film’s strong points.Dunki Drop 6: Banda | Shah Rukh Khan | Rajkumar Hirani | Taapsee PannuSpeaking of performances, Shah Rukh Khan does well and brings alive the humour and emotions effectively. However, as an old man, he’s not quite convincing. Nevertheless, it’s heartening to see him shed his superstar aura and play a character role after witnessing him in massier avatars in PATHAAN and DUNKI. Taapsee Pannu is a revelation and delivers a smashing performance. She gets the nuances in the old-age scenes quite right. Vicky Kaushal rocks the show in a cameo. Anil Grover and Vikram Kochhar are lovely and lend able support. Boman Irani and Deven Bhojani (Puru Patel) are lovely. Others do well.Pritam's music is not of chartbuster variety, but the songs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Lutt Putt Gaya' comes at a fine juncture and is pleasant. 'Main Tera Rasta Dekhunga' stands out. 'Nikle The Kabhi Hum Ghar Se', 'O Maahi' and 'Banda' are in sync with the film’s theme. Aman Pant's background score is appropriate.Muraleedharan C K, Manush Nandan and Amit Roy's cinematography is breathtaking and gives the film a big-screen appeal. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is authentic. Sham Kaushal's action is limited. Eka Lakhani's costumes are realistic and non-glamorous. Rajkumar Hirani's editing is slick.On the whole, DUNKI bears the Rajkumar Hirani stamp of filmmaking with the right message and emotions as a backdrop. However, it is not as outstanding as his previous films as the writing plays spoilsport to a great extent. At the box office, it will turn out to be a mix bag. 
  Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom (English) Movie Review: AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM works due to the performances but suffers from a disappointing climax. 
 
 
 Thu, 21 Dec 2023 10:16:49 +0200 
 AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM is the story of a man teaming up with his half-brother for a greater cause. Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is married to Mera (Amber Heard) and are proud parents to a baby boy. Arthur is finding it difficult to fulfil his duties as a king. He wants Atlantis to establish contact with the surface world as the sea residents get sick due to pollution. But Lady Karshon (Indya Moore) rejects this idea. She also has reservations about Aquaman not being around half of the time. Meanwhile, David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) has teamed up with Dr Stephen Shin (Randall Park) and their expedition takes them to the farthest corner of the Earth. There, David finds a trident. The trident, belonging to an evil force, possesses David and he suddenly gets knowledge of a lot of Atlantean secrets. David takes Dr Shin and his team's help in extracting Orichalcum, a substance that fuels ancient technology but which also can cause catastrophe on the planet. While David tries to extract Orichalcum, he comes into contact with Atlantis. And all hell breaks loose. Aquaman decides to go behind David, for which he has no choice but to team up with his half-brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson), who is imprisoned following his crimes against Atlantis. What happens next forms the rest of the film.James Wan, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Jason Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett's story is entertaining. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay has its share of fun and dramatic moments but leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are sharp and witty.James Wan's direction is simple and to the point. The director doesn’t waste time and gets straight to the point. The USP of the film is how Aquaman and Orm form a bond and it makes for a great watch. In fact, it is the best part of the film. The scene where Aquaman rescues Orm and they both cross a 'bridge' are hilarious scenes. The track of Dr Shin is also quite good, especially how he introduces himself to Aquaman and Orm.On the flipside, the climax is underwhelming. A lot of build-up is done for the villain but nothing much happens thereafter. The final flight is also quite clichéd. The family members of Aquaman are conveniently forgotten. One can understand Mera’s track being supposedly chopped off but it’s sad to see even Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) hardly being there. Lastly, the mid-credit scene is disgusting and the makers should have used their imagination better.Speaking of performances, Jason Momoa is in fine form. One can sense that he enjoys playing the superhero. Patrick Wilson is too good and it’s fun to root for his character this time. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is decent as the villain. Randall Park leaves a huge mark. Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren (Nereus) don’t have much to do. The same goes for Indya Moore.Rupert Gregson-Williams' music has a cinematic feel. Don Burgess's cinematography is breathtaking. Bill Brzeski and Sahby Mehalla's production design is world-class. Richard Sale's costumes are appealing. Action is not disturbing. VFX is great but could have been better. Kirk Morri's editing is slick.On the whole, AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM works due to Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson’s equation and performances in the film but suffers on account of a disappointing climax. At the box office, it’ll face a tough time since it’ll get sandwiched between SALAAR and DUNKI. 
  Maestro (English) Movie Review: On the whole, MAESTRO has a few shortcomings but is worth watching. 
 
 
 Wed, 20 Dec 2023 17:58:09 +0200 
 MAESTRO is the story of an American composer and his relationship with his wife. In the year 1943, Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper), 25, lives in New York City as assistant conductor to the New York Philharmonic. He gets a sudden chance to make his debut as a conductor when Bruno Walter falls ill. Leonard’s performance is well-received. This is when he has an affair with David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). This relationship ends and later, he meets an aspiring actress, Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). Both date and soon get married. They have three children – Jamie (Maya Hawke), Alexander (Sam Nivola) and Nina (Alexa Swinton). As the years pass, both Leonard and Felicia become famous in their professions. Soon, cracks develop in their relationship due to Leonard’s homosexual tendencies as well as his alcohol and substance abuse. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer's story is simple and on paper, it might not have sounded like a cinematic treat. But Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer's screenplay is replete with a lot of drama and stylish narration, which makes MAESTRO a grand biopic. But the novel script leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogues are fine. In the scenes where Bradley is holding a cigarette in his mouth, it becomes a struggle to decipher his dialogues (Thank God for subtitles).Bradley Cooper's direction is technically supreme. A part of the film is in Black-and-White. Also, a major portion of the film is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The impact of a few shots is enhanced with the use of music. Moreover, the scene where Leonard and his team play the Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection) is in one take and is seen to be believed.On the flipside, the makers try to fit in a lot in 130 minutes and it doesn’t work as intended. The script is not up to the mark in several places. The narrative style, though novel, is such that one doesn’t get fully involved in Leonard’s life.Bradley Cooper, the director, might have faltered but Bradley Cooper the actor is flawless. This is easily his most accomplished performance and also one of the best performances in recent times. One can see that he has gone all out to ensure the performance makes an impact. Carey Mulligan, too, puts her best foot forward. Her role is a bit subtle but nevertheless, it makes an impact. Both Carey and Bradley are sure to be nominated for the Oscars. These two actors dominate the film. Hence, though Matt Bomer, Maya Hawke, Sam Nivola and Alexa Swinton do well, they are not as memorable.Leonard Bernstein's music is used in the film and it's impactful. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is stunning. Kevin Thompson's production design and Mark Bridges's costumes are authentic. Michelle Tesoro's editing is novel.On the whole, MAESTRO has a few shortcomings but is worth watching for Bradley Cooper’s award-worthy performance. 
  Kadak Singh Movie Review: Despite the performances, KADAK SINGH has a complicated and disappointing second half.  
 
 
 Fri, 08 Dec 2023 11:04:51 +0200 
 KADAK SINGH is the story of a father and daughter. Arun K Srivastava (Pankaj Tripathi) works at the Department of Financial Crime (DFC), Kolkata and is very good at his job. His home environment, however, is not healthy. His wife Mimi (Khushboo Kamal) died some years ago. He single-handedly raised his children, Sakshi (Sanjana Sanghi) and Aditya (Varun Buddhadev). There has been a breakdown of communication between the father and the children. Arun usually gets angry with them, prompting Sakshi and Aditya to address their father as ‘Kadak Singh’. At DFC, Arun is working on the high-profile Golden Sun Chit Fund case. A man called Ashok Agarwal (Sanjeev Sharma) duped thousands of people of their hard-earned money and has gone into hiding. Acting on a tip-off, Arun goes to a shady hotel to catch Ashok. To ensure that no one gets suspicious, he and his female colleague head to the hotel as a couple in love. There, he bumps into Sakshi who has come there to pay off a cop who’s harassing Aditya after the latter was caught with drugs. Arun is devastated as he sees Sakshi with a male friend and assumes that he is her partner. Sakshi, meanwhile, is shocked to see her father in such a hotel with a woman and blasts him in the middle of the road. The same evening, Arun allegedly tries to end his life, presumably due to humiliation. He survives but loses his memory. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Viraf Sarkari, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, and Ritesh Shah's story is compelling. Ritesh Shah's screenplay doesn’t do justice to the promising plot in hand. All characters don’t get the required screen time and also, the narrative gets complicated. Ritesh Shah's dialogues, however, are witty and even raise laughs.Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit where it's due, he has fleshed out the characters and their equation with one another in a neat and entertaining manner. This is especially with regards to Arun’s bond with Sakshi and Arun’s bond with the nurse, Miss Kanan (Parvathy Thiruvothu). The patient-nurse bond shown in this film is a first of its kind. The first half is intriguing as weightage is given not just to the father-daughter equation but also to the scam. All is going fine until Naina’s (Jaya Ahsan) flashback.From here on, the film goes downhill as the focus shifts to the scam which is not as exciting. The daughter’s track is more or less forgotten, and this is not done since viewers have invested so much time in this character. Also, the goings-on are a bit difficult to comprehend. The makers try to infuse tension here with the scene where Sanjana goes into the shop with several mannequins. However, it looks forced. The finale is unexpected but doesn’t work as intended.The performances, however, are of a tall order and their standalone scenes are memorable. Pankaj Tripathi hits the ball out of the park with his performance which leaves viewers amused as well as moved. It’s a role in his zone and yet, he tries to make it stand out from the rest of his acts. Sanjana Sanghi is superb and shows that she has grown as an actor. It’s sad that she is hardly there in the second half. Parvathy Thiruvothu is highly entertaining and adds a lot to the film with her performance. Paresh Pahuja (Arjun) gives a sincere performance. Varun Buddhadev is dependable. Jaya Ahsan leaves a huge mark. Dilip Shankar (Tyagi; boss) and Rajan Modi (Subhash; Arun’s colleague) are fair.Shantanu Moitra's music is forgettable. Both 'Tu Jo Hai' and 'Ae Mere Dil' are relegated to the background. Shantanu Moitra's background score adds to the intrigue factor.Avik Mukhopadhyay's cinematography is lovely. The locales of Kolkata are captured in a beautiful manner. Natasha Gauba's production design is authentic. Vineet Chauhan's costumes for Pankaj Tripathi and Bidisha Kohli's costumes for the rest of the actors are realistic. Arghyakamal Mitra's editing is decent.On the whole, KADAK SINGH has a complicated and disappointing second half. The performances are the saving grace of this film. 
  Wonka (English) Movie Review: On the whole, WONKA is a sweet, 'delicious' entertainer. 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Dec 2023 17:27:43 +0200 
 WONKA is the story of an adorable chocolatier. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives in a big city to fulfil his dream of opening a chocolate shop in a plaza named Galleries Gourmet. He is poor and on the first day, all his sovereigns get used up. Willy is all set to sleep on a bench out in the open in the biting cold weather. Bleacher (Tom Davis) pretends to take pity on him and takes him to the residence of Mrs Scrubbit (Olivia Colman). She offers a room in her lodge for one sovereign a night. She even allows him to pay her the next day and asks him to sign a contract. Noodle (Calah Lane), a young girl who works at Scrubbit's property, warns him to "read the fine print". Wonka can't read and he signs the contract anyway. The next day, he arrives at the Galleries Gourmet and displays his magical chocolates to the curious onlookers. In no time, they buy his sweets, earning the wrath of the 'Chocolate cartel' run by Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Fickelgrube (Mathew Baynton). They fear that he'll eat into their chocolate business and bribe the chief police officer (Keegan-Michael Key) to oust him from town. If that is not enough, Wonka gets a shock when he arrives back at Scrubbit's place and she tells him that as per the contract he signed, he owes her 10,000 sovereigns! Wonka is unable to pay and hence, he's forced to do laundry for the next 27 years until he can pay off his debt. In the laundry room, he meets an accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), a plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), an ex-telephone exchange staffer Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and a stand-up comic Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Just like Wonka, they also stayed at Scrubbit's place and signed the contract without reading the finer details. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The characters in WONKA are based on the ones created by Roald Dahl but Paul King's story is original and imaginative. Simon Farnaby and Paul King's screenplay is entertaining and riddled with some fascinating and funny sequences that will appeal to kids and families. The dialogues add to the fun.Paul King's direction is easy to comprehend. He has given the film a Disney-style treatment and hence, there's a lot of music, scary and yet funny antagonists, touching scenes and of course, fantasy. A few scenes stand out like Noodles having chocolate for the first time. The scene at the zoo is moving and also very cute. The climax is lovely.On the flipside, the interest drops in the middle portions. Also, it is understandable that a film like this will have cinematic liberties. Yet, to see Wonka doing so much magic is difficult to digest. He could have actually pulled himself out of poverty and misery, considering what he was able to achieve with his magic tricks!Speaking of performances, Timothée Chalamet is simply charming. He handles the part with ease and ensures no one compares him with Johnny Depp, whose Wonka act in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY [2005] is legendary. Calah Lane is sweet and an actor to watch out for. Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are too good, especially when they begin their love affair. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton are fine as the villains. Keegan-Michael Key, Jim Carter, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar and Rich Fulcher lend able support. Rowan Atkinson (Father Julius) and Hugh Grant (Oompa-Loopma) add to the star value with their cameos.Joby Talbot and Neil Hannon's music is well-woven into the narrative. A few songs that are memorable are 'Have You Got A Sweet Tooth' and 'For A Moment'. Chung-hoon Chung's cinematography is splendid. Nathan Crowley's production design and Lindy Hemming's costumes are in sync with the film's fantasy theme. Mark Everson's editing is neat.On the whole, WONKA is a sweet, 'delicious' entertainer that will appeal to kids and families in metropolitan cities. 
  The Archies Movie Review: THE ARCHIES is a fine entertainer that will get whopping viewership 
 
 
 Thu, 07 Dec 2023 15:27:43 +0200 
 THE ARCHIES is the story of seven friends. The year is 1964. Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda), Betty Cooper (Khushi Kapoor), Veronica Lodge (Suhana Khan), Reggie Mantle (Vedang Raina), Jughead Jones (Mihir Ahuja), Ethel Muggs (Aditi Saigal aka Dot.) and Dilton Doiley (Yuvraj Menda) are 17-year-old kids who reside in a picturesque town in North India called Riverdale, populated by Anglo Indians. They are extremely connected with each other and with the park in Riverdale, called Green Park. Meanwhile, Hiram Lodge (Alyy Khan) plans to demolish the shops on a crucial stretch in Riverdale and convert it into a plaza. Hal’s (Satyajit Sharma) bookshop, run by Betty’s father, has to shut down, as a result. If that is not enough, then Hiram plans to cut down trees in Green Park and convert the green lung into a luxury hotel. Hiram gets Dawson (Vinay Pathak), the Town Council chief, on his side and asks him to pass the order for the hotel. Hiram, however, ensures that his name doesn’t crop up. The seven friends, meanwhile, are finding it difficult to grapple with the changes happening in their beautiful town. They are also facing struggles among themselves. Archie is confused whether he’s in love with Betty or Veronica. He also wants to move to London for higher studies, much to the annoyance of his father Fred (Suhaas Ahuja). Reggie wants to be a comedian and contribute to the newspaper, run by his father Ricky Mantle (Luke Kenny). Ricky, however, refuses as he believes in serious journalism. Dilton is hiding a deep, dark secret while Ethel’s ambition comes in the way of her interpersonal relationships. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar's story is very promising. Ayesha Devitre Dhillon, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar's screenplay is decent. It keeps one engaged in the goings-on. But one wishes the film had more funny and emotional scenes. Farhan Akhtar's dialogues are conversational while the one-liners of Veronica are witty. The one-liners, interestingly, don’t seem to belong to the 60s era but that’s fine.Zoya Akhtar's direction is uncomplicated. She deserves kudos as she has created a fictional world like never before and done justice to it. In no time, one gets sucked into Riverdale and even understand the landmark spots of the town. It’s fascinating to see the lives of teenagers in such a manner as it rarely happens in a Hindi film. A few of their dilemmas are well depicted. Two scenes that stand out are the date of Archie and Betty and Betty and Veronica confessing the truth and the scene thereafter. The political angle is well infused and parallels can also be drawn to the present-day happenings. The ending is predictable though the makers have tried to add a little nail-biting twist.On the flipside, the film never gives a ‘Wow’ feeling, that one expects in a Zoya Akhtar film. A few of the conflicts are superficial and even convenient. There are far too many songs. Lastly, the performances of the debutants are good but not out of the world.Agastya Nanda makes a sincere attempt. He definitely has the potential but in THE ARCHIES, he was a bit raw in a few scenes. The same applies to Suhana Khan. But she deserves kudos for convincingly pulling off the role of the spoiled brat. Khushi Kapoor’s character is restrained and she tries her best to do justice. Vedang Raina looks dashing and is fair. Mihir Ahuja is the one who raises maximum laughs. Dot is alright and suffers from limited screen time. Yuvraj Menda is lovely and the way he says ‘Thank You’ might get picked up. Speaking of the supporting cast, Alyy Khan, Satyajit Sharma and Vinay Pathak leave a tremendous mark followed by Luke Kenny and Suhaas Ahuja. James Alter (Mike Gomes; council member) and Puja Sarup (Mrs Otters; council member) are damn good in small roles. Tara Sharma (Mary Andrews), Koel Purie (Alice Cooper), Delnaaz Irani (Pam) and Sheena Khalid (new salon owner) are wasted.The Archies | Zoya Akhtar | Official Trailer | 7th December | Netflix IndiaTHE ARCHIES has too many songs and the ones that leave the maximum impact are ‘Sunoh’ and 'Yeh Saari Aawazein'. The latter comes at a crucial juncture and has soulful lyrics (Javed Akhtar). 'Everything Is Politics' is a surprise. 'Dhishoom Dhishoom' and 'Va Va Voom' are based on fascinating ideas and are superbly choreographed. 'Jab Tum Na Thee' and 'In Raahon Mein' are okay. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and Jim Satya's background score is in sync with the film's mood and zone.Nikos Andritsakis' cinematography is as breathtaking as the locales shown in the film. Suzanne Caplan Merwanji's production design is award-winning. The sets are fascinating and yet very much seem believable. Poornamrita Singh's costumes are fashionable and can become a rage. Philm CGI, Netfx Mumbai and Cinegence VFX's VFX is top-class. Nitin Baid's editing is slick.On the whole, THE ARCHIES is a fine entertainer that will get a whopping viewership on Netflix due to the fascinating setting, kids-friendly and family-friendly theme, style, music, message and above all, the excitement of watching the debut of the most talked about star kids in recent times. 
  Animal Movie Review: ANIMAL is a powerful film that rests on Ranbir Kapoor’s outstanding performance, clap worthy massy scenes. 
 
 
 Fri, 01 Dec 2023 16:29:08 +0200 
 ANIMAL is the story of an obsessed son. Ranvijay (Ranbir Kapoor) is the son of Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), who heads the successful Swastik Steel company. Ranvijay resides in a palatial mansion in Delhi with Balbir, his mother Jyoti (Charu Shankar), sisters Reet (Saloni Batra) and Roop (Anshul Chauhan). Ranvijay crazily loves Balbir. But Balbir doesn’t reciprocate as he’s too busy with work. Both also get into fights and after one such showdown, Balbir sends Ranvijay away for studies. Ranvijay returns and attends the engagement of his school classmate, Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna). He always had feelings for her and he confesses it in such a way that Geetanjali falls for him. She breaks her engagement. Meanwhile, on Balbir’s 60th birthday, Ranvijay fights with Varun (Siddhant Karnick), Reet’s husband. One thing leads to another and Ranvijay is kicked out. He marries Geetanjali and moves to the US. 8 years later, he returns when Balbir gets shot by unidentified assailants. Varun tries to act pricey but Ranvijay takes charge. He makes it his life mission to find out who tried killing the man whom he has worshipped since birth. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's story is simple. Sandeep Reddy Vanga, Pranay Reddy Vanga and Suresh Bandaru's screenplay, however, packs in a lot. There are several sub-plots and characters and riveting moments that give an audience an experience of a wholesome entertainer. However, there are cracks in the second half in the writing. Saurabh Gupta's dialogues are out-of-the-box and some of the one-liners are shocking.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's direction is stylish and massy. He peppers the film with enough dramatic and action scenes to keep the interest going. Though the film is 3 hours and 23 minutes long, one doesn’t get bored at all. The father-son and the husband-wife tracks stand out and are the most memorable, when it comes to the emotional aspect. As for the massy aspect, the scene where Ranvijay teaches college bullies a lesson will be greeted with whistles. The entire episode 30 minutes before the interval takes the impact to dizzying heights. Right from Ranvijay heading to Punjab to get his cousins on board to the much-talked-about 18-minute long interval block, the impact is seen to be believed. There will be a frenzy in cinemas, especially in the Northern belt. Also, ANIMAL is a real Pan-India film as there’s also a Maharashtrian connection which will appeal to audiences in the Western state.Sadly, after an out-of-the-world first half, ANIMAL drops slightly in the second half. The massy stuff, which is present in the first half in ample doses, is absent post-interval. Also, some of the scenes between the husband and wife may not be appreciated by a section of the female audience. Lastly, the runtime could have been shorter.Animal (Offical Trailer): Ranbir Kapoor | Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor, Bobby DeolSpeaking of performances, Ranbir Kapoor shines. The way he gets into the skin of his character is seen to be believed. The supreme actor has given several outstanding performances in the past but in ANIMAL, hands down, is his best performance till date. Anil Kapoor has fewer dialogues, but he also rocks the show. His expressions are bang-on and speaks a lot. The scenes where he raises his voice are arresting. Rashmika Mandanna is quite good and leaves a mark in certain scenes, especially in the second half. Bobby Deol (Abrar) looks dashing and in form. Sadly, his screen time is very limited. Siddhant Karnick is memorable in a small role. Charu Shankar and Saloni Batra are decent. Anshul Chauhan doesn’t get much scope. Triptii Dimri (Zoya) puts in a sincere act. Suresh Oberoi (Dadaji) and Prem Chopra (Bade Daarji) have nothing much to do. The same goes for Shakti Kapoor (Mishra). Upendra Limaye (Freddy) is thoroughly entertaining in a special appearance. Bablu Prithviraj (Asrar Haque) and Saurabh Sachdeva (Abid Haque) are fair. The actors playing Ranvijay's cousins do well.ANIMAL's soundtrack is quite good. 'Arjun Vailly' is the best song of the lot and also the most impactful. 'Hua Main' and 'Satranga' are well-shot. 'Pehle Bhi Main' and 'Papa Meri Jaan' are touching. Harshvardhan Rameshwar's background score adds to the tension and mass appeal.Amit Roy's cinematography is cinematic. Suresh Selvarajan's production design is rich. Sheetal Iqbal Sharma's costumes are in sync with the status of the characters. Supreme Sundar's action is very violent and disturbing. Do It Creative Ltd, NY VFXWaala, Visual Birds Studio, Famous Studio, and Red Chillies.VFX's VFX is first-class. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's editing is appropriate, but a few scenes could have been done away with.On the whole, ANIMAL is a powerful film that rests on Ranbir Kapoor’s outstanding performance, clap-worthy massy scenes, and an interval block that is simply out of the world. At the box office, the tremendous hype and curiosity will lead to a fantabulous opening, and it will emerge as a Blockbuster at the ticket windows. 
  Sam Bahadur Movie Review: SAM BAHADUR is a well intentioned biopic.  
 
 
 Fri, 01 Dec 2023 14:19:40 +0200 
 SAM BAHADUR is the story of India’s greatest soldier. The year is 1933. Sam Manekshaw (Vicky Kaushal) is posted in Mussoorie as a corporal in the British Indian Army. He comes across Silloo (Sanya Malhotra). Both fall in love and get married. Sam soon rises in the Army ranks thanks to his valour and no-nonsense approach. During World War II, he is posted in Burma where he fights the Japanese troops bravely. He gets shot 7 times and yet survives. During the partition, he gets an offer to join the Pakistani Army but he insists on being a part of the Indian Army. After independence, he continues to serve the army and is soon posted in Wellington, Tamil Nadu as Major General. A few years later, the Indo-China dispute erupts and this is when he comes across the future Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (Fatima Sana Shaikh). What happens next forms the rest of the film.Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's story is worthy as the life of Sam Manekshaw is truly fascinating. Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's screenplay, however, doesn’t do complete justice. A film of this kind should have numerous high points which SAM BAHADUR sadly lacks. Bhavani Iyer, Shantanu Srivastava and Meghna Gulzar's dialogues thankfully add to the drama and humour.Meghna Gulzar's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, she makes a sincere attempt to tell the story of Sam Manekshaw. She doesn’t attempt to add unnecessary drama, action or dialoguebaazi for the heck of it. Everything in the film is there for a reason and it gives one a feeling that the director is serious about doing justice to his life story. Sam’s sense of humour was famous and this aspect is well taken care of. A few scenes are memorable like Sam’s brutal injury in Burma, Sam accused of being an anti-national and Sam’s bond with Yahya Khan (Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub). The manner in which Sam manages to fly the plane from Srinagar despite no lights is the best scene of the film.On the flipside, the director should have added some sort of cinematic high, without compromising on other aspects. SAM BAHADUR is the biopic of an army man who has achieved so much. His life events have been dramatic and so much could have been done. Sadly, Meghna Gulzar, in the second half, chooses to simply document his life episodes without adding any cinematic value. This is pretty evident in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, which serves as the climax. It fails to give goosebumps as the audience will not realize the achievements of Sam in this battle, thanks to the execution.Sam Bahadur – Official Trailer | Vicky Kaushal | Meghna GulzarVicky Kaushal, however, doesn’t give any reason to complain. The actor gets into the skin of the character like never before and delivers the finest performance of his career. It’s also praiseworthy how he has worked on his body language and accent as well. Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh, too, deliver fine performances. But they don’t have much to do. Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub is decent initially and looks unrecognizable and unconvincing in the second half. He’s wasted in the climax. Neeraj Kabi (Jawaharlal Nehru) is fine. Govind Namdev (Sardar Patel) is great but sadly, he's there for just a scene. Shreas Pardiwala (Behruz) and the actors playing Swami, Dippy and others are fair.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is forgettable. Both 'Badhte Chalo' and 'Banda' don't have a shelf life. 'Itni Si Baat', however, is well picturized. Ketan Sodha's background score uplifts the impact to some extent.Jay I Patel's cinematography is neat. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is detailed. Sachin Lovelekar, Divvya Gambhir and Nidhhi Gambhir's costumes are straight out of the bygone era. Parvez Shaikh's action makes its presence felt and isn’t disturbing. Nitin Baid's editing could have been sharper.On the whole, SAM BAHADUR is a well-intentioned biopic and showcases Vicky Kaushal like never before. But it suffers due to the docudrama treatment. At the box office, the mighty opposition in the form of ANIMAL will affect its prospects to a great extent. 
  Napoleon (English) Movie Review: NAPOLEON rests on fine performances and spectacular battle scenes. 
 
 
 Fri, 24 Nov 2023 11:00:25 +0200 
 NAPOLEON is the story of the rise and fall of one of the greatest kings in history. Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) rises to fame after the French Revolution of 1789. In September 1793, he successfully lays siege in Toulon and defeats the British. The battle gives him a lot of recognition and he's promoted from the post of colonel to brigadier general. He soon falls in love with Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby) and has a tumultuous relationship with her. In 1798, he proceeds to Egypt to further undermine the British and their trade interests in Asia. He cuts short his trip when he learns that Joséphine is having an affair with Hippolyte Charles (Jannis Niewöhner). This is seen as an act of desertion but Napoleon saves himself smartly. Later on, he, Sieyes (Julian Rhind-Tutt) and Roger Ducos (Benedict Martin) plan a coup. One thing leads to another and he becomes the king of France. He continues to rise with his tactical battle strategies but also commits certain mistakes on the way. What happens next forms the rest of the film.David Scarpa's story is brilliant. The roller-coaster life of Napoleon Bonaparte is fit for a cinematic adaptation. David Scarpa's screenplay is interesting, but only in parts. The lack of a simple explanation goes heavily against the film. The dialogues are appropriate.Ridley Scott's direction is cinematic. He has a certain style and finesse and that is surely evident in several scenes. He depicts Napoleon Bonaparte with all his glory and flaws and that makes him human and closer to reality. He wows the audience in the battle scenes and certain dramatic scenes like Napoleon confronting Joséphine after learning that she cheated on him, Napoleon running to save his life after attempting a coup, Napoleon’s mother proving who is infertile among the couple, Napoleon wittily convincing the fifth regiment to switch sides, etc. As for the action scenes, the opening sequence and the Battle of Austerlitz take the cake.On the flipside, several scenes stand out when seen individually. As part of the film, it doesn’t make the desired impact as the makers skip several episodes of his life. It seems like the makers expect the viewers to know Napoleon’s life story before they catch the film. Since that’s obviously not possible, one might not be able to fully comprehend the goings-on or change in the equation between the characters. The track that is easy to comprehend is that of Napoleon and Joséphine. But the bond they share is crazy and might put off people. Lastly, it’s a niche film and not meant for mainstream audiences.Speaking of performances, Joaquin Phoenix once again hits the ball out of the park. He depicts his valour and vulnerability with utmost conviction. Vanessa Kirby, too, puts her best foot forward and seems at ease in essaying the challenging role. Edouard Philipponnat (Tsar of Russia) looks dashing and does well. The other actors like Jannis Niewöhner, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Benedict Martin, Sam Troughton (Robespierre), Paul Rhys (Talleyrand), Anna Mawn (The Duchess Marie-Louise) etc perform ably but get overshadowed by Joaquin and Vanessa. Catherine Walker (Marie-Antoinette), however, leaves a huge mark in a cameo.Martin Phipps's music tries to enhance the impact in several scenes. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is top-class. Arthur Max's production design and David Crossman and Janty Yates' costumes are well-researched. Action is brutal and not for the faint-hearted. VFX is top-class. Claire Simpson and Sam Restivo's editing is weak. The 160-minute long film should have been shorter by 10-15 minutes.On the whole, NAPOLEON rests on fine performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby and spectacular battle scenes. However, the long length, lack of simplistic narrative and niche appeal will restrict its box office collections. 
  Farrey Movie Review: FARREY is a well made and well intentioned film laced with fine performances. 
 
 
 Fri, 24 Nov 2023 09:00:13 +0200 
 FARREY is the story of a group of students trying to cheat the system. Niyati (Alizeh) is an orphan who is raised by a kind-hearted warden (Ronit Roy) at his orphanage, Ishrat Kada, in Delhi. Niyati is very intelligent and she emerges as a topper in her exams. She even gets admission to the prestigious Winston International School. The principal, Vedita Mathew (Shilpa Shukla), agrees to bear her transport and other costs, knowing her financial condition. Niyati joins the school along with Akash (Sahil Mehta), who also comes from an impoverished background and like her, is very intelligent. Niyati becomes friends with her rich classmates, Chavi (Prasanna Bisht), Prateek (Zeyn Shaw), Sahil (Arshvir Wahi) and Rishabh (Paras Nagpal). Chavi reveals to her that her father (Arbaaz Khan) has asked her to get good marks so that she gets admission to Stanford. However, Chavi is a weak student. For the mid-term exams, Niyati helps Chavi by giving her the answers written on an eraser. Chavi asks Niyati to help her again, for the next set of papers, and this time she’s ready to pay a huge amount. Niyati, at first, refuses due to the risk. Meanwhile, Vedita informs Niyati that the latter has a chance to bag a scholarship at Oxford. Niyati also learns that the warden, who is like her father, is struggling to run the orphanage. Hence, she agrees to help Chavi and her friends and even devises a smart way to cheat. All is going well until Niyati gets caught. What happens next forms the rest of the film.FARREY is an official remake of the 2017 Thai film BAD GENIUS (Directed by Nattawut Poonpiriya). The story is fresh and relatable. Soumendra Padhi and Abhishek Yadav's screenplay is tight. Not many films have been made on this topic. Hence, one looks forward to what happens next. The ending, however, is shaky. Soumendra Padhi and Abhishek Yadav's dialogues are conversational.Soumendra Padhi's direction is classy. This is not a conventional film. But he has executed certain scenes with style and it adds to the film's appeal. The scenes where the characters are copying are nail-biting. The Australia sequence, meanwhile, is intriguing.On the flipside, the ending is sweet but there's a shift in the tonality. One expects the film to continue being thrilling and maybe even get violent. But the opposite happens, and it doesn't gel well with the overall tone of the film. Secondly, while the director tries his best to explain the complexities, in some places, he fails to do so. This will leave viewers confused. Moreover, the voice record scene is a bit misleading as well. Lastly, the title is not quite simple and appears confusing.Alizeh delivers a smashing performance. It’s difficult to believe this is her debut film as she performs exactly as per the character's demand. Prasanna Bisht shines and rocks the show, especially in the second half. Sahil Mehta is decent initially but makes his presence felt in the second half. Zeyn Shaw is decent. Ronit Roy is dependable as always. Juhi Babbar Soni (Zoya) and Shilpa Shukla leave a mark. Arshvir Wahi, Paras Nagpal, Bhavna Choudhary (Priyanka) and Shivangi Negi (Monica) are okay and don't have much to do. Arbaaz Khan is fair in a cameo.Farrey Official Trailer | Salman Khan | Alizeh Agnihotri | Soumendra PadhiSachin-Jigar's music is not of the chartbuster variety. 'Ghar Pe Party Hai' and 'Machade Tabahi' are peppy while 'O Bandeya' is intended to be soulful. But these songs are not memorable. Sidhant Mathur's background score is gripping.Keiko Nakahara's cinematography is unusual. Susheel Mishra's production design is very rich, especially in the scenes set in Chavi's mansion. Natascha Charak and Nikita Mohanty's costumes are in sync with the characters and their class. Paramjeet Pamma's action is minimal and realistic. Zubin Sheikh's editing is slick.On the whole, FARREY is a well-made and well-intentioned film and is laced with fine performances by the debutants. At the box office, the confusing title, the lack of promotions and awareness is likely to impact the footfalls and the collections. The film will need a strong word of mouth to attract the audience. 
  Khichdi 2 Movie Review: On the whole, KHICHDI 2 suffers from a weak second half 
 
 
 Fri, 17 Nov 2023 14:11:24 +0200 
 KHICHDI 2 is the story of a madcap family on a dangerous mission. Kushal (Anant Vidhaat) of TIA (Thodi Intelligent Agency) meets Hansa (Supriya Pathak), Himanshu (J D Majethia), Praful (Rajeev Mehta), Jayshree (Vandana Pathak) and Babuji (Anang Desai) and asks them for help. He wants them to go to a country called Paanthukistan. The ruler of Paanthukistan, Imam Kha Ke Thuk (Rajeev Mehta), looks like Praful. Hence, the plan is that Hansa, Himanshu, Jayshree and Babuji should enter Paanthukistan pretending to be documentary filmmakers. Praful will be kept hidden in a box. When the time is right, Himanshu will feed a spiked meal to Imam Kha Ke Thuk. The king will faint and Praful will masquerade as the ruler. Kushal then wants them to find a scientist, Makhanwala (Paresh Ganatra), who has designed a dangerous robot. TIA doesn't want the robot to fall into the hands of the king as he can use it for frightening consequences. The plan is simple, but the Parekh family is well...Parekh family. Training them for this mission is a mission in itself. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Aatish Kapadia's story is superb, though it gives a déjà vu of TERE BIN LADEN [2010] and THE INTERVIEW [2014]. Aatish Kapadia's screenplay (additional screenplay by Sourav Ghosh) is weak, though some moments are quite hilarious and well thought out. Aatish Kapadia's dialogues are one of the highlights of the film. In fact, it’s the dialogues that is the saving grace.Aatish Kapadia's direction is okay. He keeps the direction simple and uncomplicated. The run time is just 121 minutes, and the film doesn’t bore even for a moment. He smartly starts the film with the helicopter sequence and then goes on a flashback. It sets the mood instantly.On the flipside, the second half is weak. With a plot like this, the film could have gone anywhere. But the writers and director let go of the opportunity. They rely solely on dialogues and gags to infuse entertainment instead of adding some physical comedy. After all, this is a film, and they should have tried to add some cinematic value. A few jokes are funny but don’t get registered. For example, the name of the British official in the 1947 sequence is Lord Mittibartan, but the audience won’t notice it properly. A crucial character is wasted, and the death of another character is unimaginative and needlessly violent for a film of this sort.Speaking of performances, Supriya Pathak takes the cake as she gets to mouth the maximum jokes. Rajeev Mehta plays both the roles with ease. J D Majethia and Vandana Pathak add to the fun and entertainment convincingly. Anang Desai is adorable. Kirti Kulhari (Parminder) is wasted. She should have been there in the climax, ideally. Anant Vidhaat lends able support. Paresh Ganatra doesn’t get much scope. Kiku Sharda is entertaining as the robot. Reyaansh Vir Chaddha (Wazir) is okay while Flora Saini (Rani Gulkanda) is over the top. Farah Khan and Pratik Gandhi are fair.Chirantan Bhatt's music is poor. 'Vande Raka' has bizarre lyrics but is shot well. 'Naach Naach' is well woven into the film. The Paanthukistan national anthem is funny. Raju Singh's background score is in sync with the film’s tone. Vijay Soni's cinematography is appropriate. Jayant Deshmukh's production design is theatrical. Falguni Trivedi's costumes are as per the character’s traits. Raj Shinde's action works. Crazy VFX's VFX is very poor. Aajay A Kumar's editing is fine.On the whole, KHICHDI 2 suffers from a weak second half and an unimaginative script. At the box office, it might surprise if the target audience accepts the film. 
  The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes (English) Movie Review: On the whole, THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS & SNAKES is an entertaining flick 
 
 
 Thu, 16 Nov 2023 17:19:17 +0200 
 THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES is the story of a bond shared by a mentor with his tribute in times of despair. The film is set 64 years before the events of the first film in the series. 18-year-old Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) lives in the capital city of Panem. He belongs to the Snow family which was once quite powerful but suffered immensely in the War. To win back the prestige of his family, he studies hard and comes out with flying colours. As a result, he's chosen to mentor a tribute (a participant) in the 10th edition of The Hunger Games. He is assigned the District 12 female tribute, Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She catches attention with her singing skills. When she reaches the capital city, Coriolanus goes to meet her in the Capital Zoo, where all the players are kept. The footage is shown on television and it earns the sympathy of the residents. Dr Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the head gamemaker, is upset with Coriolanus's behaviour. But Coriolanus explains that the games are not getting good viewership as viewers don't feel connected to the players. He gives ideas to increase the viewership, which gets accepted. Meanwhile, Coriolanus forms a bond with Lucy and both get quite close. The games finally begin and Coriolanus tries his best to help Lucy win, by hook or by crook. Unknown to all, Coriolanus has a hidden agenda. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The film is based on the novel ‘The Ballad Of Songbirds and Snakes’ by Suzanne Collins. The story is gripping and imaginative. Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt's screenplay is effective but gets too lengthy after a point. The dialogues are normal. The absence of English subtitles makes it a bit difficult in some scenes.Francis Lawrence's direction is neat. He keeps the storytelling simple and introduces the characters and the setting effectively. The previous two parts of the series had faced criticism and the director seems to have corrected those minuses. A few scenes stand out like Lucy’s entry, Coriolanus and Lucy bonding in the zoo at night, Lucy being sent water bottles to save herself, etc. The finale of the games is very memorable. In fact, the nail-biting moments are aplenty in the film.On the flipside, the run time of 157 minutes is way too much. Secondly, moviegoers might feel a bit cheated since The Hunger Games episode ends an hour before the end credits roll. The third act has its share of moments but it’s not something viewers have signed up for. Also, it is not as thrilling as the second act.THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES belongs to Rachel Zegler. The actress has been getting better with each film. She performs the difficult role with élan and perfection. Tom Blyth gets a bit overshadowed by Rachel but delivers a solid performance. Viola Davis is needlessly loud, although her act is watchable. Peter Dinklage (Casca Highbottom) leaves a mark, as expected. Jason Schwartzman (Lucretius Flickerman; television host) is entertaining. Josh Andrés Rivera (Sejanus Plinth) is okay. Hunter Schafer (Tigris Snow) and Fionnula Flanagan (Grandmother) don't get much scope. Nick Benson (Jessup; male tribute from 12th district) and Mackenzie Lansing (Coral; who is determined to finish Lucy in the games) make their presence felt.James Newton Howard's music has a cinematic feel. Jo Willems' cinematography is spectacular, especially in the games arena and climax. Uli Hanisch's production design is very appealing. Trish Summerville's costumes are stylish. The action is not too gory. VFX is top-class. Mark Yoshikawa's editing is weak. The film should have been shorter by at least 15 minutes.On the whole, THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS &amp; SNAKES is an entertaining flick and will be loved by the fans of the series. But the lack of promotion, competition from TIGER 3 and the crucial World Cup final match on Sunday will eat into its business. 
  Apurva Movie Review: On the whole, APURVA is a well-made gripping thriller 
 
 
 Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:02:03 +0200 
 APURVA is the story of a girl in difficult circumstances. In Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, Jugnu (Rajpal Yadav), Sukha (Abhishek Banerjee), Balli (Sumit Gulati) and Chota (Aaditya Gupta) are highway thieves. They get a tip that a truck is carrying important goods that can fetch them good money. They start heading to their destination when suddenly, a tourist bus refuses to give them way. An angry Jugnu, who is behind the wheel, overtakes the bus and stops his car in front of it. He and the gang member kill the bus driver and the cleaner and begin looting the passengers. One of the passengers is Apurva (Tara Sutaria), a Gwalior-based girl who’s on her way to meet her fiancé, Siddharth (Dhairya Karwa). She hides her phone from the thieves. But Sukha spots the phone. At that moment, Siddharth calls her. Sukha picks up the phone and insults Siddharth. Siddharth hits back. Sukha gets enraged and kidnaps Apurva. They take her to a secluded place with the idea of raping her and then finishing her off. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's story is clichéd. But Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's screenplay is gripping. Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's dialogues are raw. Since it’s a realistic film, there are barely any punchy dialogues.Nikhil Nagesh Bhat's direction is neat. He keeps the duration at check (100 minutes) and also the focus is on the principal track mainly. He makes good use of the arid landscape and peppers the film with a lot of nail-biting moments. The film gets better once Apurva decides to fight back. The scene involving the well is clap-worthy.On the flipside, the film is okay in the initial portions until Apurva’s entry. A film like this needs to show violence and disturbing visuals, so that the viewers cheer for the protagonist when she succeeds. Yet, a few shots are crude and needlessly added. The ending is a bit underwhelming. Also, the film gives a déjà vu of films like NH 10 [2015].Tara Sutaria delivers the best performance of her career and looks convincing as a girl fighting off dangerous goons. Rajpal Yadav is quite good and though he has a comic image, he slips into the role effortlessly. Abhishek Banerjee is dependable, as expected. Sumit Gulati and Aaditya Gupta also do well. Dhairya Karwa lends able support. The actor playing the jyotish and cop are fair.Vishal Mishra's music is forgettable. Both 'Diwali' and 'Hai Khuda' don’t register at all. Ketan Sodha's background score adds to the tension.Anshuman Mahaley's cinematography is terrific. The impact of a few scenes goes up thanks to the camerawork. Kristel Dias' production design is realistic. Anisha Jain's costumes are straight out of life. Salaam Ansari's action is as per the film’s mood. Shivkumar Panicker's editing is sharp.On the whole, APURVA is a well-made gripping thriller. 
  Tiger 3 Movie Review: TIGER 3 has SALMANIA written all over it with lots of seeti-maar moments 
 
 
 Sun, 12 Nov 2023 10:38:45 +0200 
 TIGER 3 is the story of a spy whose family is in danger. Avinash Singh Rathore aka Tiger (Salman Khan) goes on a dangerous mission to save Gopi (Ranvir Shorey) of R&amp;AW. Tiger rescues Gopi who in turn gives the former the information that Pakistan is planning a dangerous mission. Before breathing his last breath, Gopi also tells Tiger that his wife Zoya (Katrina Kaif), an ex-ISI official, is also a part of this mission. Tiger keeps a close tab on Zoya and realizes that she hasn't compromised. Maithili Menon (Revathy), the new chief of R&amp;AW, asks Tiger to go to St. Petersburg, Russia, and meet Jibran Shaikh (Neeraj Purohit), who has vital information. Tiger saves Jibran in the nick of time only to realize that Zoya is trying to assassinate the latter. Zoya then confesses that she is compelled to work for ex-ISI official, Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi), as he has kept their son Junior (Sartaaj Kakkar) hostage. Aatish tells Tiger and Zoya to head to Istanbul, Turkey for a dangerous mission that will make them most wanted in their respective countries. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Aditya Chopra's story is promising. Shridhar Raghavan's screenplay is fine but is unimaginative in several places. Anckur Chaudhry's dialogues lack the punch. A film like this should have had many more hard-hitting dialogues.Maneesh Sharma's direction is fine. To give credit where it's due, he handles the scale and grandeur like a pro. A few scenes are memorable like Tiger’s entry, Tiger getting suspicious of Zoya, Pathaan’s (Shah Rukh Khan) entry etc. The national anthem sequence in the climax will give goosebumps. Aatish’s flashback and his connection with Zoya is intriguing. Viewers will be fascinated to know that Tiger and Zoya almost came face to face before the events of EK THA TIGER [2012].On the flipside, the direction is not smooth and is incoherent in some scenes. The action gives a feeling of been-there-done-that. The sequence of Tiger and Zoya robbing the briefcase is very similar to Pathaan and Rubai (Deepika Padukone) stealing Raktbeej in Moscow. Also, the whole mission is to save Pakistan and this might not go down well with certain sections of the audience. The makers should have clearly highlighted that saving Pakistan was important in order to safeguard the interests of India.Speaking of performances, Salman Khan rocks the show. He underplays his part and looks great in action scenes. Katrina Kaif, too, gets the chance to shine. Her scenes in the hamam and the bunker are memorable. Emraan Hashmi looks dashing and tries his best to be menacing. But he is let down a bit by the script. Ranvir Shorey is fair in a cameo. Revathy and Simran (Pakistan PM Nasreen Irani) leave a mark. Kumud Mishra (Rakesh) is dependable. Anant Vidhaat (Karan), Chandrachoor Rai (Nikhil), Gavie Chahal (Abrar) and Danish Bhat (Javed) are okay. Vishal Jethwa (Hassan) and Sartaaj Kakkar don't get much scope. The same goes for Ridhi Dogra (Shaheen). Danish Husain (D G Riaz) and Shahid Lateef (General Haq) are passable. Aamir Bashir (Rehaan Nazar) passes muster. Michelle Lee (Gen Zimou) is too good. Lastly, Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan add to the star value as well as the mass element of the film.Tiger 3 Trailer | Salman Khan | Katrina Kaif | Maneesh Sharma | YRF Spy UniversePritam's music isn’t impressive. 'Leke Prabhu Ka Naam' is catchy but won’t have a shelf life. 'Ruaan' is more memorable for its situation than the tune. Tanuj Tiku's background score enhances the entertainment.Anay Om Goswamy's cinematography is spectacular. The various locales of the world are well captured. Mayur Sharma's production design is appealing. Franz Spilhaus, Oh Sea Young and Sunil Rodrigues' action is quite good when seen individually. But when compared with the films of the Spy Universe, it is not novel. Anaita Shroff Adajania, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, Ashley Rebello and Darshan Jalan's costumes are stylish. yFX's VFX matches global standards. Rameshwar S Bhagat's editing is appropriate but isn’t smooth in a few scenes.On the whole TIGER 3 is a predictable action fare that has SALMANIA written all over it with lots of seeti-maar moments - Salman's introduction scene, Shah Rukh Khan's cameo, and the climax. At the box office, it will start huge due to the immense hype and is likely to emerge as a super hit. 
  The Marvels (English) Movie Review: THE MARVELS is a fun-filled superhero saga. 
 
 
 Fri, 10 Nov 2023 16:55:15 +0200 
 THE MARVELS is the story of a group of superheroes coming together for a greater cause. Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the leader of Hala, retrieves one-half of the Quantum Bands from the planet MB-418. She is searching for another band that she plans to use to save Hala though it will cause destruction elsewhere. Unknown to her, the other band or bangle is with Kamala Khan aka Ms Marvel (Iman Vellani) in Jersey City. Meanwhile, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) asks Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to investigate some glitch in the jump point. Monica and Carol touch the glitch-laden jump point at the same time. This results in both of them along with Kamala switching places through teleportation. The trio are unable to understand this phenomenon at first. Meanwhile, Dar-Benn is having a meeting with Emperor Dro'ge (Gary Lewis), the leader of the Skrulls at a refugee colony on planet Tarnax. The teleportation confusion leads them to the Tarnax and they start fighting with Dar-Benn's army. An enraged Dar-Benn destroys Tarnax. Carol, Monica and Kamala now decide to understand how and why they managed to switch, how they can control and what should be done to stop Dar-Benn. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik's story stands out from the rest of the Marvel films. Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik's screenplay is quite fresh and loaded with some fascinating and hilarious moments. The dialogues are entertaining and keep the narrative light.Nia DaCosta's direction is decent. She doesn't waste time and gets to the story from the first shot. The first 15-20 minutes are very entertaining as the superheroes get transported from one place to another, leading to madness. The Aladna sequence is short but sweet. The bond shared by the three heroes is also worth it. The scene of the flerkens (cat-like creatures) in the pre-climax takes the cake and brings the house down.On the flipside, THE MARVELS is the shortest film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one gets a feeling that it gets over soon. One expects more, especially in the climax fight. The villain track is weak. The whole bit about the trio teleporting is complex and the layman might not fully get it. A few developments are bewildering, especially why Carol never failed to repair Hala’s problems all these years. Lastly, the buzz for the film is very limited.Speaking of performances, Iman Vellani puts up a very entertaining act. The way she fangirls over Captain Marvel might give a déjà vu of Peter Parker's obsession with Iron Man in the SPIDER-MAN films. Yet, Iman adds her cuteness to ensure it doesn’t remind viewers of a similar mentor-protégé track in MCU. Brie Larson delivers a confident performance. Her bit of a goofy act in some scenes is likeable. Teyonah Parris is decent and gets overpowered by Brie and Iman. Samuel L Jackson is dependable as expected and raises laughs. Zawe Ashton is fine while Gary Lewis doesn’t get much scope. Park Seo-joon (Prince Yan) is too good and one wishes that he had a longer screen time. Zenobia Shroff (Muneeba; Kamala's mother), Mohan Kapur (Yusuf; Kamala's father) and Saagar Shaikh (Aamir; Kamala's brother) are fine.Laura Karpman's music has the trademark superhero movie stamp. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is appropriate. Cara Brower's production design is rich. Lindsay Pugh's costumes are stylish, especially the non-superhero outfits of the trio. Action is not disturbing at all. VFX is top-class. Catrin Hedström and Evan Schiff's editing is slick.On the whole, THE MARVELS is a fun-filled superhero saga. But due to limited buzz and immense competition from TIGER 3, it’ll need strong word of mouth to put up respectable numbers. 
  The Lady Killer Movie Review: THE LADY KILLER fails to entice 
 
 
 Fri, 03 Nov 2023 22:24:56 +0200 
 THE LADY KILLER is the story of a man who gets entangled in a mess. Rajendar Joshi (Arjun Kapoor) runs a chemist shop in Nainital. He wants to set up a diagnostic centre but the bank refuses his loan as he is a defaulter. He is in a relationship with Gajra (Priyanka Bose), a married woman. One day, Rajendar’s cop friend Rawat (Deepak Tokas) asks him to meet Vikram Burman (S M Zaheer), a former prince who is now settled in Nainital. Vikram wants to set up a hospital and Rajendar realizes that he might benefit. Rajendar goes to his mansion where he’s greeted by Vikram’s daughter Jansey (Bhumi Pednekar). Vikram gets attracted to her and is moved when he learns that Vikram sexually assaults her. Both decide to murder Vikram. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s story is fine and has a James Headley Chase feel. Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s screenplay, however, is not effective, especially in the second half. Ajay Bahl, Pawan Sony and Mayank Tiwari’s dialogues are normal.Ajay Bahl’s direction is disappointing. He handles a few portions well in the first half like Rajendar and Jansey’s first meeting, the lovers deciding to murder, the intermission point and the day of the murder.From here on, things go downhill. Instead of giving a thrilling and nail-biting moments, the film will make viewers restless as they would wonder what exactly is happening. Moreover, there are gaps in the narrative. The entire track of Rajendar’s ex-girlfriend is not explained and one wonders why it is even there in the film in the first place. No explanation is given as to why the overdose of insulin didn’t have the desired impact. Lastly, it’s also bewildering that the cops failed to track the running lovers though they switched on their phones a couple of times.The Lady Killer (Trailer): Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi PednekarSpeaking of performances, Arjun Kapoor looks dashing and does well, more so in the finale. Bhumi Pednekar rocks the show. It’s a very difficult and challenging character but she pulls it off with ease. Priyanka Bose is terrific and her character’s actions save the film from becoming a disaster. S M Zaheer and Deepak Tokas are okay. Ekavali Khanna (Madhuri) and Denzil Smith (Dr Khurana) leave a mark.THE LADY KILLER is a song-less film. Ketan Sodha’s background score is intriguing. Anuj Dhawan’s cinematography is spectacular. The snow-capped ranges are beautifully captured by the lensman. Rita Ghosh’s production design is appealing. Eka Lakhani and Seerat Kaur’s costumes are stylish and at the same time, realistic. Aezaz Gulab’s action is fair.  Pranav Mistry’s editing is jerky.On the whole, THE LADY KILLER fails to entice because of a weak second half. At the box office, it got a token and a limited release with no buzz or awareness whatsoever and will therefore meet with a disastrous fate. 
  Aankh Micholi Movie Review: Besides a bad climax, AANKH MICHOLI fails to induce laughs.  
 
 
 Fri, 03 Nov 2023 11:41:49 +0200 
 AANKH MICHOLI is the story of two crazy families. Paro (Mrunal Thakur) lives in Hoshiarpur, Punjab with her father Navjot Singh (Paresh Rawal), brothers Harbhajan Singh (Abhishek Banerjee) and Yuvraj Singh (Sharman Joshi), Yuvraj's wife Billo (Divya Dutta) and nephew Goldie. Navjot has the habit of forgetting, Yuvraj is deaf and Harbhajan stammers. Paro, meanwhile, suffers from night blindness. While she is on a trip to Switzerland with her friends, Paro comes across Rohit Patel (Abhimanyu Dassani) and falls in love with him. But Rohit doesn't notice her. Once Paro is back, she is informed by her family that they have found a match for her for marriage. The guy turns out to be none other than Rohit. Paro, however, is not able to see him as Rohit arrives at her place at night, when she can't see anything. Paro's family, meanwhile, hasn't told the truth about Paro's night blindness to Rohit and his parents (Darshan Jariwala, Grusha Kapoor). Paro is asked to pretend that there's no issue with her vision. Billo, however, is determined to mess things up, especially after she learns that even she wasn't told about Yuvraj's deafness before marriage. But that's not all. Rohit is also hiding a big secret. What happens next forms the rest of the film.The story is promising and in the right hands, this would have been a laugh-a-minute-riot. The screenplay is not upto the mark and has limited humour. The dialogues are funny in places.Umesh Shukla's direction fails to do justice to the plot at hand. The beginning portions are shaky. Thankfully, the film gets watchable once Rohit comes to see Paro. The intermission point has an unexpected twist and works well. Post-interval, the film suffers as the comic scenes are not that effective. And though one doesn't have to look for logic in such films, yet the absurdities will astonish viewers. This is especially true in the climax. It won't be a surprise if the serious scene in the end elicits more laughs than the scenes which are actually meant to be funny!Abhimanyu Dassani is just decent at best. Mrunal Thakur has a superb screen presence and tries to rise above the substandard script. Paresh Rawal is dependable but looks a bit off in the initial scenes. Divya Dutta is too good and the best performer in the film. Sharman Joshi and Abhishek Banerjee are okay. Darshan Jariwala and Grusha Kapoor are passable. Vijay Raaz (Bhatti) tries his best to raise laughs.Aankh Micholi – Official Trailer | Abhimanyu Dassani, Mrunal Thakur, Paresh RawalSachin-Jigar's music is forgettable. The title song registers but 'Kaleja Kad Ke', 'Ve Dholna' and 'Shaadi Dope Hai' are poor. Sachin-Jigar's background score is in sync with the film's mood.Sameer Arya's cinematography is neat. Preeti Sharma's costumes are glamorous yet realistic. Parul Bose's production design is theatrical. Steven Bernard's editing is fine.On the whole, AANKH MICHOLI fails to induce laughs and is laced with a very bad climax. A film like this would be ideal for TV viewing and won’t stand a chance on the big screen. 
  Killers Of The Flower Moon (English) Movie Review: On the whole, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is worthy of the Oscars 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:53:15 +0200 
 KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is the story of a town rocked by a series of murders. The year is 1919. The town of Fairfax, Oklahoma is majorly populated with Native Americans who have become rich after the discovery of oil. William King Hale (Robert De Niro) resides in the same town and is considered a friend by the Native Americans. Unknown to them, he harbours hate for the community and wants to usurp their wealth. His nephew Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns from the war after serving as a cook in the infantry. William asks him to turn taxi driver to earn a livelihood. Mollie (Lily Gladstone) becomes his regular customer. Sparks fly and they fall in love. Mollie suspects that Ernest wants to marry her for her wealth. Her sisters - Minnie (Jillian Dion), Anna (Cara Jade Myers) and Rita (JaNae Collins) - however disagree with her as they remind her that even Ernest's uncle is quite wealthy. Soon, Ernest and Mollie marry. William brainwashes Ernest that he'll get a greater share in the wealth if Mollie's family members die. William manages to kill Minnie through slow poisoning. Mollie's mother Lizzie (Tantoo Cardinal) dies due to old age. Anna is murdered at the orders of William. The doctors, who perform the post-mortem, hide the bullet. William devises a plan to kill Rita and also to slowly poison Mollie. When more than 15-20 members of their community die mysteriously, the Native Americans decide to fight back and find the root cause. Their attempts prove futile and yet, they continue to get to the bottom of these deaths. What happens next forms the rest of the film.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is based on the novel of the same name by David Grann. The story is incredible, and it’ll be shocking for the viewers to know that this incident took place in real life. Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese's screenplay is engaging but unnecessarily lengthy. The dialogues are normal and sharp in places.Martin Scorsese's direction is superlative. He has used his creativity at places and at the same time, given an old-school style treatment. His narrative is unhurried, and, in many ways, it works as audiences neatly adjust to the setting, characters and the goings-on. Some scenes are memorable like William and Ernest’s first meeting after the latter returns, the discovery of Anna’s body, the explosion scene, William assaulting Ernest, William’s breakdown in the jail etc. The scene of the effects of the slow poison on Mollie is gut-wrenching. The last scene of the film is amusing.On the flipside, the film has a run time of 3 hours 26 minutes. In other words, it is too lengthy. The film also drops in the middle and there’s a possibility that the audience might walk out of boredom and miss the second half, which is much better. Moreover, the treatment is not mainstream. Some aspects can be confusing, and it might be too much for the audience to remember.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is embellished with award-winning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio hits the ball out of the park and deserves another Oscar. Robert De Niro rocks the show yet again, as expected. Lily Gladstone is a surprise, and her career will zoom to another level after this performance. Tantoo Cardinal is decent. Jillian Dion and JaNae Collins get no scope. But Cara Jade Myers leaves a mark. Jesse Plemons (Tom White) lends able support. Brendan Fraser (W S Hamilton) is nice but gets no scope. The other actors who do well are Scott Shepherd (Byron), Tommy Schultz (Blackie), Pete Yorn (Acie Kirby) and Sturgill Simpson (Henry Grammer)Robbie Robertson's music is unique and enhances impact. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is quite stunning. Jack Fisk's production design is reminiscent of the bygone era. Jacqueline West's costumes are detailed and realistic. Action is minimal but very gory. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing should have been crisper.On the whole, KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON is worthy of the Oscars, especially for its performances. But due to the extremely long length and niche appeal, it’ll find it difficult to pull in the audience. 
  Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video Movie Review: On the whole, SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO rests on the bravura performances of Nimrat Kaur and Radhika Madan 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:33:43 +0200 
 SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO is the story of a missing girl. Sajini Shinde (Radhika Madan) is a physics teacher at K P School, Pune. Her authoritarian father Suryakant Shinde (Subodh Bhave), mother Urmila (Sneha Raikar), uncle Sadashiv (Shashank Shende) and brother Aakash (Ashutosh Gaikwad) reside in Ahmednagar. Her dominating fiancé Siddhant Kadam (Soham Majumdar) works in an IT company in Bengaluru. Sajini travels to Singapore with her colleagues, Shraddha (Shruti Vyas) and Chhavi (Rashmi Agdekar), for work purposes. At night, Sajini celebrates her birthday at a nightclub. She gets drunk and dances with two skimpily-clad men. Shraddha shoots her video on her phone. While sending work-related pictures to the school group, she mistakenly transfers Sajini’s video as well. The school management is shocked. The video leaks on the internet and goes viral. Due to the pressure from the management and teachers, principal Kalyani Pandit (Bhagyashree) is compelled to fire Sajini, Shraddha and Chhavi. Sajini is shattered. She’s too scared to call her father. Siddhant, meanwhile, blasts her for her ‘mistake’. The next morning, Sajini disappears. She posts a message on her social media account wherein she declares that she’s about to end her life. She blames her father and Siddhant for her drastic step. Inspector Bela Barot (Nimrat Kaur) is assigned the case. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Mikhil Musale and Parinda Joshi's story is interesting and raises some important points. Mikhil Musale and Parinda Joshi's screenplay (additional screenplay by Anu Singh Choudhary and Kshitij Patwardhan) is captivating. The writing, however, gets a bit shaky in the second half. The dialogues pack a punch, especially the ones mouthed by Nimrat Kaur.Mikhil Musale's direction is good and much better than his work in his previous outing, MADE IN CHINA [2019]. He has kept the duration in check. He neatly introduces the characters and their equation with each other. The climax is unpredictable. A few scenes stand out like Inspector Ram Pawar (Chinmay Mandlekar) referring to Bela as Doberman, the meeting between the lawyers and the co-accused, the reporter remarking that she would have fallen for Siddhant’s lies if she hadn’t known him earlier, etc.On the flipside, a few scenes are difficult to comprehend like Bela discovering the message of Sajini’s sister. In fact, the focus shifts from the investigation to what is happening in the lives of Sajini’s loved ones. Though it is important, one starts missing Bela and her investigation. The track of the influencer is unconvincing. There are a lot of Marathi dialogues in the film, which restricts its appeal in the North.Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video | Trailer | Nimrat Kaur, Radhika Madan, BhagyashreeSpeaking of performances, Nimrat Kaur is terrific, and this is surely her best performance to date. One will be surprised to discover this side of her personality in this film. One wishes this film is a success so that a sequel can be made, and we can see her character yet again. Radhika Madan, too, puts her best foot forward and is like the soul of the film. Soham Majumdar, of KABIR SINGH [2019] fame, is superb and proves that he’s a fine talent. Subodh Bhave and Chinmay Mandlekar are dependable as expected. Shruti Vyas is good but is let down by the writing. Rashmi Agdekar is fine but gets a raw deal. Bhagyashree is lovely and apt for the part. Ashutosh Gaikwad is fair. Kiran Karmarkar (Yashwant Desai) and Sumeet Vyas (Lalit) are too good. Kavi Shastri (Jayant) is wasted. Akshay Tanksale (Milind) is okay.Sachin-Jigar's music is forgettable. 'Nana Chi Taang' is well-woven into the script, though. Hitesh Sonik's background score is in sync with the mood and theme of the film.Tribhuvan Babu Sadineni's cinematography is neat. The locales of Pune and the surrounding areas are well-captured. Swapnil Bhalerao and Madhur Madhavan's production design is great. Shivank Vikram Kapoor's costumes are straight out of life. The ones worn by Nimrat are quite appealing. Javed Karim's action is minimal and is fine. Sumeet Kotian's editing is slick.On the whole, SAJINI SHINDE KA VIRAL VIDEO rests on the bravura performances of Nimrat Kaur and Radhika Madan and raises some important issues. But due to negligible buzz, the film will face a very tough time at the box office. 
  12th Fail Movie Review: 12TH FAIL is a well-intentioned inspiring saga. 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 11:19:17 +0200 
 12TH FAIL is the story of a man who rises against all odds. The year is 1997. Manoj Kumar Sharma (Vikrant Massey) lives in Chambal with his family. His father (Harish Khanna) has been suspended for his honesty. Manoj, meanwhile, appears for his 12th exams confidently though he hasn't prepared properly. This is because the school teacher himself is going to help the students in cheating. The plan gets foiled as Dushyant Sharma (Priyanshu Chatterjee), the newly appointed DSP, stops the malpractice. As a result, all the students fail, including Manoj. When Dushyant rescues Manoj's brother from corrupt cops, he realizes how power in the hands of an honest officer can bring positive change. Manoj expresses a desire to be like Dushyant. Dushyant asks him to not resort to cheating to become successful like him. After clearing his 12th exams successfully, Manoj graduates with BA and moves to Gwalior to appear for PCS exams. The exams, however, are discontinued, prompting Manoj to head to Delhi to appear for the IPS exams. Manoj develops cold feet when he sees the amount of people who have assembled just like him to change their fortunes. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's story, based on true events, is superb. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's screenplay is engaging. This is not an easy topic but the master filmmaker-writer manages to pen an interesting script that keeps the interest going. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's dialogues are sharp and clapworthy.Vidhu Vinod Chopra's direction is top notch. The impact in certain sequences is enhanced due to the creativity in the form of long shots, novel camerawork, background noise to depict realism etc. Some scenes that stand out are the beginning scene, Dushyant saving the life of Manoj's brother and the subsequent conversation, Gauri bhaiya (Anshuman Pushkar)'s entry, the intermission point, Manoj meeting his father at the flour mill etc. The climax is gripping while the final scene is touching.On the flipside, a few developments seem convincing. The track of the love interest's family is not exciting. Manoj lying to Shraddha (Medha Shankar) is not well explained especially when he's very truthful otherwise. The finale is touching but it gives a déjà vu of THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS [2006] and 3 IDIOTS [2009]. Moreover, the film has a film festival-type treatment, which restricts its appeal. Lastly, the soundtrack is poor.Vikrant Massey gets into the skin of his character. It’s difficult to believe that he’s not a villager turned IAS aspirant since he has given a very realistic portrayal. This is easily his best performance for sure. Medha Shankar is lovely and puts up a confident performance. Anant Vijay Joshi (Pritam Pandey) is likeable. Anshuman Pushkar leaves a huge mark. Priyanshu Chatterjee wins hearts with his cameo appearance. Harish Khanna is decent. Sarita Joshi (Manoj’s grandmother) is entertaining. Vikas Divyakirti (Teacher) delivers a stupendous performance. Geeta Agrawal Sharma (Pushpa; Manoj’s mother) doesn’t get much scope.12th Fail – Official Trailer | Vidhu Vinod Chopra | In Cinemas WorldwideShantanu Moitra's music is poor. 'Restart' does get registered but is not a song which will have a long shelf life. Shantanu Moitra's background score is much better. Manav Shrotriya's sound design is award-winningRangarajan Ramabadran's cinematography is eye-catching, be it the scenes of Chambal or that of the crowded Mukherjee Nagar in Delhi. It’s also commendable that the film has been shot in real locations. Prashant Bidkar's production design is realistic. The same goes for Malvika Bajaj's costumes. Jaskunwar Kohli and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's editing is well-paced.On the whole, 12TH FAIL is a well-intentioned inspiring saga. At the box office, it will find the going tough since the awareness about the film is near-zero. 
  Tejas Movie Review: TEJAS suffers due to a lack of logic and too many cinematic liberties. 
 
 
 Fri, 27 Oct 2023 11:05:14 +0200 
 TEJAS is the story of a brave officer. Tejas Gill (Kangana Ranaut) is a wing commander in the Indian Air Force. She and her colleague Arfa (Anshul Chauhan) are about to get suspended after they save an officer Vivek (Kashyap Shangari) from a prohibited area in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Vivek is thankful to Tejas and asks her out for a date. Tejas agrees but is still under the trauma of losing her parents and boyfriend Ekveer (Varun Mitra) during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. One day, news comes in that an engineer named Shikhar Ali has been captured by terrorists in Pakistan. They ask for Kashmir in return for his release. Videos of Shikhar being nabbed are viral on the internet. Tejas sees his videos and realizes that he’s none other than her batchmate, Prashant (Vishak Nair). She also realizes that he has used Morse code to send his location, which is Mir Ali. Tejas informs about it to the IAF chief R K Panicker (Ashish Vidyarthi). She also requests him to allow her to go to Pakistan and rescue Prashant. Panicker agrees. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Sarvesh Mewara's story has all the trappings of a blockbuster. Sarvesh Mewara's screenplay, however, is silly. The narrative is riddled with scenes of convenience and also gives a deja vu of films DUS [2005], CAPTAIN PHILLIPS [2013], MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, TOP GUN: MAVERICK [2022] etc. Sarvesh Mewara's dialogues are just fine.Sarvesh Mewara's direction is not upto the mark. To give credit where it's due, some scenes are well executed like the sequence of the tribals and the 26/11 attack. He also packs in a lot in 118 minutes.Sadly, the minuses outweigh the plusses. The film defies logic and how. After a rocking intro scene, the film falls when it’s shown that Tejas is the only one in her class to know about the Tejas aircraft. But the fact is that any IAF aspirant would know these basic details. Later, Tejas is the only one among all the defence officials in the country to guess that Prashant has used Morse code to send his location. When Tejas tells her senior that she wishes to go to Pakistan, we assume that the latter will have some hesitation. Instead, the senior officer straight away agrees as if infiltrating into Pakistan is akin to a cakewalk! Then the manner in which Tejas hides the aircrafts at the Pakistani airport is a smart idea but looks childish on screen.Kangana Ranaut delivers a fine performance but looks quite stiff in scenes where she’s supposed to look rough and tough. Anshul Chauhan lends able support and also raises laughs. Ashish Vidyarthi is dependable. Varun Mitra is lovely while Kashyap Shangari gets no scope. Sunit Tandon (Academy teacher) leaves a mark. Vishak Nair is okay. Rohed Khan (Sarqalam), Rio Kapadia (RAW Chief) and Mohan Agashe (Prime Minister) do well. Mushtaq Kak (Khatooni) hams.Tejas Official Trailer | Kangana Ranaut | Sarvesh Mewara | Ronnie ScrewvalaShashwat Sachdev's music fails to register. 'Jaan Da' and 'Aag Udi' are the best of the lot while the rest of the songs like 'Dil Hai Ranjhana', 'Reh Jao Na' and 'Ishq Hai Ranjhe Da' are forgettable. Shashwat Sachdev's background score is uplifting.Hari K Vedantam's cinematography is appropriate. Harpal Singh Barda, Vikram Dahiya and Amin Khatib's action is entertaining. Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray's production design is passable. Rohit Chaturvedi's costumes are realistic. After Studios and Creative Doctor's VFX is tacky and very poor. Aarif Sheikh's editing is fine though it could have been crisper.On the whole, TEJAS suffers due to a lack of logic and too many cinematic liberties. At the box office, it is likely to meet with a disastrous fate as there is hardly any buzz or excitement around the movie. 
  Ganapath – A Hero Is Born Movie Review: On the whole, GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN fails to impress. 
 
 
 Fri, 20 Oct 2023 17:32:33 +0200 
 GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN is the story of a man who is meant for greatness. The year is 2070. Due to a major war, the poor have become poorer. They live in a settlement where the rich control the food and water supply. The rich, meanwhile, reside in the luxurious Silver City. A mysterious man named Dalini rules this territory. His trusted aide, John (Ziad Baki), conducts boxing matches and earns money through the bets placed by the uber-rich. Guddu (Tiger Shroff) works for John along with his uncle Kaizad (Jameel Khan) and Senior (Girish Kulkarni). The latter detests Guddu. One day, John asks Guddu to take his girlfriend Rosie (Elli AvrRam) out to a nightclub while he’s busy in a meeting. Rosie gets physical with Guddu. John catches them red-handed and buries them alive. Miraculously, Guddu survives. Kaizad asks him to move away to a settlement of poor people up in the hills and meet Shiva (Rahman). Once he meets Shiva, Guddu is supposed to tell him ‘Ganapath is here’. Guddu does as instructed. He meets Shiva and his close confidante, Jassi (Kriti Sanon). Shiva is blind while Jassi is tough and fights quite well. Unknown to Guddu, he is Ganapath or the saviour of the poor, as predicted by a revered man (Amitabh Bachchan). But while Guddu is good at analysing fighters and their strengths and weaknesses, he’s not a fighter himself. Shiva and Jassi decide to train him. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vikas Bahl's story is clichéd and gives a déjà vu of CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA [2009]. Vikas Bahl's screenplay is unexciting. A few scenes are well thought of but they give a been-there-done-that feeling. Vikas Bahl's dialogues are just fine.Vikas Bahl's direction is not up to the mark. To give credit its due, he has handled a few dramatic moments well. Guddu’s transformation also makes for a nice watch. The fight at the intermission point is worth it. The lead actors have also been presented stylishly.Sadly, the film is riddled with shortcomings. The futuristic element could have been the USP but the makers fail to do justice to it. The poor VFX further messes things up in this regard. For a film about one man fighting the system, it’s mandatory that the audience should be moved by the plight of the have-nots and be wowed by the protagonist’s heroism. Both these factors are missing. Moreover, the twist in the climax is very predictable. One can guess it from a mile away.Speaking of performances, Tiger Shroff has never looked so dashing. His performance is quite good. Kriti Sanon gives a sizzling performance. She looks convincing while doing action. Amitabh Bachchan is hardly there and is fine. Ziad Baki is decent. Jameel Khan and Girish Kulkarni are dependable. Rahman is the surprise of the film. Elli AvrRam looks hot but is wasted. Jess Liaudin (Tabahi) is over the top. Shruthy Menon (Shaina) is fine.Ganapath Official Hindi Trailer | Amitabh Bachchan, Tiger Shroff, Kriti SanonSongs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Sara Zamana' manages to register to an extent followed by 'Jai Ganesha', 'Hum Aaye Hain', 'Lafda Kar De' and 'Time 2 Shine'. Salim-Sulaiman's background score is passable.Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti's cinematography is neat. Amit Ray &amp; Subrata Chakrobarty's production design is unimaginative. Aki Narula, Sukriti Grover and Akangshe Chopra's costumes are quite cool, especially the ones worn by Tiger and Kriti. Tim Man and Vikram Dahiya's action is entertaining and not at all gory. After Studio, Number 9 VFX and Maadfam Studios' VFX is tacky. Ritesh Soni's editing is appropriate.On the whole, GANAPATH – A HERO IS BORN fails to impress due to a clichéd storyline, poor VFX and predictable second half. At the box office, the limited buzz and huge costs will prove detrimental. 
  Yaariyan 2 Movie Review: On the whole, YAARIYAN 2 is a decent entertainer. 
 
 
 Fri, 20 Oct 2023 17:04:05 +0200 
 YAARIYAN 2 is the story of three cousins. Laadli Chibber (Divya Khosla Kumar) lives in Shimla with her mother (Lillete Dubey). She was suffering from thalassemia but has now recovered. Laadli wanted to fall in love and then get married. Her mother, however, asks her to meet Abhay Singh Katyal (Yash Das Gupta). Both click and they decide to get married. Laadli immediately calls Shikhar (Meezaan Jafri) and Bajrang Das Khatri aka Bajju (Pearl V Puri), her cousins who are closest to her, for her wedding. After marriage, Laadli moves to Mumbai with Abhay. Bajju, too, works in Mumbai. Shikhar is forced to shift to Mumbai and work as a delivery boy after he faces a roadblock in his biking career. Laadli faces trouble in marriage as Abhay seems indifferent to her. Shikhar changes his SIM card and gets hounded with calls from Ikroor (Anaswara Rajan). He meets her and both fall in love. Bajju, meanwhile, begins a relationship with Shona (Warina Hussain). Shikhar, however, has reservations about Shona and her behaviour. This causes a rift between the trio. What happens next forms the rest of the film.YAARIYAN 2 is based on BANGALORE DAYS [2014] and the story is promising. We have seen films about siblings and friends. A film about cousins is rare. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's screenplay flows well and is replete with some nice dramatic and emotional sequences. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's dialogues are youthful and modern. However, the dialogue about nappies is repeated far too many times.Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's direction is creative. The director duo is known for adding a lot even to their ordinary shots. This trademark stamp is visible from start to finish. While they handle all tracks well, the track of the dead girl's parents is very moving. The race sequence, meanwhile, is gripping.On the flipside, there's hardly any comedy. For a film about friendship, there should have been more humour. The character of Bajji gets a raw deal in the second half as he is hardly there. Moreover, at 150 minutes, the film is too lengthy.Speaking of performances, Divya Khosla Kumar looks charming and performs the difficult role with ease. Meezaan Jafri shows a marked improvement compared to his work in HUNGAMA 2 [2021]. Pearl V Puri is decent but could have been better. Yash Das Gupta emerges as the best performer in the film. Warina Hussain looks stunning but could have done better in some difficult scenes. Bhagyashri Borse (Raajlaxmi) looks stunning and leaves a mark. Anaswara Rajan is lovely but goes over the top in emotional scenes. Priya Prakash Warrier is wasted. Murli Sharma is dependable. Lillete Dubey hams.Yaariyan 2 (Official Trailer): Pearl V Puri, Divya Khosla Kumar, Meezaan JafriThe songs are decent though it's in no way close to the hit soundtrack of YAARIYAN [2014]. 'Saure Ghar' is the best followed by 'Simroon Tera Naam', 'Oonchi Oonchi Deewarein', 'Suit Patiala', 'Heer Bhi Roye', 'Peene De' and 'Bewafaa Tu'. 'Sunny Sunny 2.0' and 'Blue Hai Paani Paani' are just okay. JAM8's background score is functional.C R Ravi Yadav's cinematography is stunning. Mumbai has never been captured like this before. Shankar Samanta's production design is rich. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's costumes are glamorous, especially the ones worn by Raajlaxmi. Allan Amin's action is fine. Abhishek Kumar Singh's editing is weak. The film should have been shorter by 15-20 minutes.On the whole, YAARIYAN 2 is a decent entertainer. 
  Dhak Dhak Movie Review: DHAK DHAK is a well-intentioned genuine effort laced with some fine performances. 
 
 
 Fri, 13 Oct 2023 12:00:57 +0200 
 DHAK DHAK is the story of four women bikers. Sky (Fatima Sana Shaikh) is a vlogger specializing in bikes. She breaks up with her boyfriend Shrey (Nishank Verma) after her nude pictures are leaked from his phone. She wants to bag a contract to film the Barcelona Auto Expo. The person in charge, Nishant Kakkar (Hrriday Malhotra), agrees but on one condition - she should create a video series that will emotionally move people. This is when she comes across Manpreet Kaur Sethi aka Mahi (Ratna Pathak Shah). She is in her 60s and rides a motorcycle after she wins the two-wheeler in a contest. Mahi tells Sky that it's her dream to ride her bike at Khardung La Pass, the highest motorable road in the world. Sky agrees to take her there knowing that this is the story she wants to tell. When both try to get their bike fixed, they bump into Uzma (Dia Mirza). She comes on board as a mechanic. Then they are joined by Manjari (Sanjana Sanghi), a god-fearing vegetarian from Govardhan who lies to her parents that she's flying to Leh instead of going there by road. All four of them have distinct personalities and the journey is tough and full of obstacles. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's story is brilliant and waiting to be told. Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's screenplay does partial justice to the plot at hand. The characters are beautifully fleshed out and at the same time, they also raise some important issues. However, things don’t get properly established in the second half. Parijat Joshi and Tarun Dudeja's dialogues (additional dialogues by Anvita Dutt) are simple and some one-liners raise laughs.Tarun Dudeja's direction is uncomplicated, despite the flashbacks. He begins the film by establishing that the four ladies have embarked on their biking trip. He then depicts their back stories and it makes for an engaging watch. It is not easy for women travelling alone and this aspect is depicted perfectly. At the same time, not everyone tries to take advantage and this is also taken care of by the beautiful truck driver sequence. Sky’s outburst, the reunion in the pre-climax and the finale are also worth watching.Sadly, the film is not without its share of blemishes. Nothing much happens in the first hour of the post-interval portion. The four ladies spare Moshe (Benedict Garrett) despite his wrongdoing and this is difficult to digest. The same goes for the sequence when Manjari’s parents allow her to continue her journey on a bike, though they are livid with her. A few aspects like Mahi being ignored by her family and her bond with Prabjyot (Harshpal Singh) are not established well. The conclusion of Uzma’s track is too simplistic. Lastly, it is bewildering how no one from the ashram delivers the oxygen cylinder to a hospitalized Mahi. Agreed that Manjari was not in a position to do so but anyone else should have done the needful, especially when it was a life-and-death situation.Dhak Dhak – Official Trailer | Ratna Pathak Shah | Dia Mirza | Fatima Sana Shaikh | Sanjana SanghiAll four leading heroines do a fine job. Fatima Sana Shaikh has the maximum screen time and carries off the role with panache and style. Ratna Pathak Shah as always is a pleasure to watch. Dia Mirza is too good and she underplays her part with panache. Sanjana Sanghi goes a bit overboard in some scenes but otherwise, she puts up a fine act. Nishank Verma lends able support. The same goes for Hrriday Malhotra. Harshpal Singh is there only in the beginning and is okay. Dheerendra Dwivedi (Shabbir; Uzma's husband) leaves a mark. Kallirroi Tziafeta (Martha; Manjari’s foreign friend) is lovely while Dr Lakha Lehri (Taran; truck driver) is adorable. Ozgur Kurt (Bernett) is too good. Benedict Garrett is forgettable and hams. Poonam Gurung (Kung Fu Nun) is great, but her track doesn’t have the desired impact.DHAK DHAK has several songs but only 'Re Banjara' and 'Akhiyan Criminal' get registered. The rest of them like 'Sadke Sadke', 'Woh Tara', 'Safar Pe Chale' and 'Farzi Duniya' are forgettable. Anurag Saika's background score is in sync with the film’s theme.Sreechith Vijayan Damodar's cinematography is splendid. The locales of the mountain ranges, especially, are captured beautifully. Nilesh Eknath Wagh's production design is realistic. Natasha Vohra's costumes reflect the character’s personalities. The ones worn by Fatima are appealing. Abdul Aziz Khokhar's action is minimal. Manish Sharma's editing is slick.On the whole, DHAK DHAK is a well-intentioned genuine effort laced with some fine performances by the leading ladies. But due to a weak second half and negligible buzz, the film will suffer at the box office. 
  The Exorcist - Believer (English) Movie Review: On the whole, THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER fails to impress. 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 18:48:20 +0200 
 THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER is the story of two girls who get possessed. The year is 2010. Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr) visits Port Au Prince, Haiti with his pregnant wife Sorenne (Tracey Graves). An earthquake takes place that severely injures Sorenne. She dies but the baby survives. 13 years later, Victor is settled in Percy, Georgia with his daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett). One day, Angela makes a plan with her classmate Katherine (Olivia Marcum) to go to the woods after school. When they don't return, their worried parents call the cops. The police officers try their best but are unable to locate their whereabouts. 3 days later, Angela and Catherine are found in a barn 30 miles away from the woods. Shockingly, they have no memory of how they reached the barn, that too without shoes. On top of that, they believe that they were gone only a few hours. Once back home, both Angela and Catherine start behaving weirdly, scaring their parents. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Scott Teems, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green's story is promising. Peter Sattler and David Gordon Green's screenplay, however, is devoid of tension and scary moments. The dialogues are normal.David Gordon Green's direction is just okay. The director sets up the story well initially. The sequence of the earthquake and that of the missing girls is very captivating. Moreover, getting the character from the first part, THE EXORCIST [1973], is a masterstroke.Unfortunately, the makers fail to utilize this trump card to its potential. Firstly, many are not aware that the character they see on screen has a connection with the first part. The makers should have established it well. Secondly, the second half is clichéd and something we have seen countless times before. The film also ends abruptly, probably because a sequel is in the offing.Leslie Odom Jr doesn't put on a nice act and is emotionless in several scenes. Lidya Jewett and Olivia Marcum, however, are excellent in their respective parts. Tracey Graves is lovely in a cameo. Norbert Leo Butz (Tony; Katherine's father) and Jennifer Nettles (Miranda, Katherine's mother) are decent. The same goes for E J Bonilla (Father Maddox) and Ann Dowd (Ann). Okwui Okpokwasili (Dr Beehibe) doesn't have much to do.David Wingo and Amman Abbasi's is functional. Michael Simmonds' cinematography is appropriate. Brandon Tonner-Connolly's production design is nothing special. VFX is minimal and works. Tim Alverson's editing is sharp.On the whole, THE EXORCIST: BELIEVER fails to impress due to a weak and clichéd second half. At the box office, it'll face a tough time though the association with the brand EXORCIST might attract a tiny section of the audience. 
  Thank You For Coming Movie Review: On the whole, THANK YOU FOR COMING is a progressive film 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:51:32 +0200 
 THANK YOU FOR COMING is the story of a girl trying to find love. Kanika Kapoor (Bhumi Pednekar) lives in Delhi with her mother Beena (Natasha Rastogi) and nani Kishori (Dolly Ahluwalia). Since she was a child, she has been shamed for being raised by a single mother and for her liberal views. She gets involved with several guys and it never translates into a healthy, long-term relationship. She is about to turn 32 and is shattered that she hasn't found her prince charming yet. Moreover, she has never experienced an orgasm in her life. On her birthday, Arjun Malhotra (Karan Kundra) shows interest in her and gets invited to her party. However, he lands up at the bash with a date, Rushi Kalra (Shehnaaz Gill). Rushi and Kanika become friends and the former advises the latter that she should marry someone who loves her. She finds that person in Jeevan (Pradhuman Singh), a simpleton selling toilet showers and who loves her immensely. Kanika agrees to marry him though her mother and her best friends - Pallavi (Dolly Singh) and Tina (Shibani Bedi) - advise her against doing so. At the engagement party, she calls her ex-boyfriends like Booni Bhatia, Shekhar Sinha, Rahul Kasturia (Sushant Divgikar), and Professor (Anil Kapoor). She drinks like crazy at the engagement party. The next day, she wakes up with no memory of the previous night. But she does remember that she experienced orgasm for the first time ever. However, she doesn't remember who she slept with - was it Jeevan or Booni or Shekhar or Rahul or Professor? What happens next forms the rest of the film.Radhika Anand's story is promising and could have translated into a path-breaking film. Radhika Anand's screenplay, however, is a mixed bag. While some scenes are very impactful and entertaining, a few of them could have been penned in a better manner. Radhika Anand and Prashasti Singh's dialogues are too funny but only in select places. A character in the beginning remarks that she attains orgasm simply by looking at her hot body. This dialogue will bring the house down and ideally, the film should have been replete with such one-liners from start to finish.Karan Boolani's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, he touches upon some important topics like childhood traumas, women being shamed for living life on their terms, women being shamed by other women, the majority of women not experiencing orgasm ever etc. Instead of getting preachy, he uses humour and some touching scenes to convey the message. Moreover, the plot is outrageous and one does get intrigued especially when Kanika begins her mission to find out who she slept with on her engagement.On the flipside, the film moves too quickly and doesn’t let the characters grow organically. Kanika’s decision to marry Jeevan seems sudden. Moreover, it’s bewildering that the makers never show what Kanika and her friends do for a living. Professional achievements are also important for women. But the women in the film are not focusing on it at all. The humour is limited and moreover, the finale at the school is quite silly.Thank You For Coming | Official Trailer | Bhumi Pednekar | Shehnaaz GillSpeaking of performances, Bhumi Pednekar plays the character with aplomb. For an actor who played these semi-urban and rural characters, it can be challenging to crack a part that is so drastically different. Bhumi, however, comes out with flying colours. Dolly Singh and Shibani Bedi lend able support. Pradhuman Singh is unrecognizable and does well. Natasha Rastogi is lovely and Dolly Ahluwalia is dependable, as expected. Shehnaaz Gill is entertaining but is hardly there. Kusha Kapila (Neha) is wasted. Gautmik (Karan; Pallavi's husband) and Saloni Daini (Rania Das; Tina's daughter) leave a mark. Sushant Divgikar is quite good and has a fine screen presence. Karan Kundrra is okay. Anil Kapoor is excellent in a cameo.Songs are well-woven into the narrative. 'Desi Wine' works the best followed by 'Pari Hoon Main', 'Haanji' and 'Baaraat'. None of the songs, however, are of the chartbuster variety. Aman Pant's background score is functional.Anil Mehta's cinematography is neat. Manisha Melwani and Devanshi Tuli's styling is one of the highlights of the film. Disha Dey's production design is realistic. Shweta Venkat Mathew and Manan Sagar's editing is too sharp.On the whole, THANK YOU FOR COMING is a progressive film that raises some important topics, has its share of entertaining scenes, and delivers a shock value. But it suffers on account of the script, limited humour, and silly climax. At the box office, the lack of awareness will prove detrimental to its business, and it will be appreciated only by a tiny section of the multiplex audience. 
  Mission Raniganj Movie Review: On the whole, MISSION RANIGANJ makes an impact due to the subject 
 
 
 Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:37:30 +0200 
 MISSION RANIGANJ is the story of a man trying to rescue miners against all odds. The year is 1989. Jaswant Singh Gill (Akshay Kumar) is a rescue officer and is based in Raniganj, West Bengal. On November 11, hundreds of miners descend into the mine of Mahabir Coillery at night. An underground blast goes wrong and water starts gushing with powerful force. The miners attempt to escape. Several of them safely make it to the ground. But a group of 65 miners get stuck. The next morning, Jaswant volunteers to rescue the miners. D Sen (Dibyendu Bhattacharya), who is a local contact, however, attempts to take over the rescue operation. He comes up with a plan and tries to save the miners. However, his plan fails. On the other hand, Jaswant finds out the highest point in the underground mine. He then drills a hole at that very place and attempts to establish contact. The miners, too, realize that they need to be at the highest point for better chances of rescue. With great difficulty, they try to reach there but get stuck due to a stoppage wall between them and the highest point. Meanwhile, time is running fast and Jaswant needs to rescue them before they drown or die by inhaling a poisonous gas present in the mine. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Deepak Kingrani's story (story idea by Poonam Gill), inspired by a true incident, is intriguing. Vipul K Rawal's screenplay is engaging. The writer has peppered the narrative with dramatic and tense moments. Deepak Kingrani's dialogues are okay. A film like this should have had more powerful dialogues.Tinu Suresh Desai's direction is superb. At 138 minutes, he has kept the duration in check. He has packed in a lot and also kept things simple for most parts. The obstacles that Jaswant encounters from locating the miners to establishing contact to manoeuvring politics make for a great watch. Some scenes that stand out are Jaswant offering water to a lady in distress, Jaswant convincing the railway officer to slow down the speed of the trains, the intermission, Jaswant establishing contact with the miners, Jaswant promising O P Dayal (Shishir Sharma) that he’ll have tea with him next day etc. The finale is nail-biting.On the flipside, the first half is a bit weak and doesn’t create the desired impact. The VFX is poor. Lastly, there are cinematic liberties in the finale which take away the realism.Speaking of performances, Akshay Kumar’s beard looks a bit unreal. But his performance packs a punch as expected. One can’t help but root for him in this mission. Parineeti Chopra (Nirdosh) puts up a nice act but her role seems forced. Kumud Mishra (R K Ujjwal) is fine but showing him smoking in all scenes gets too much after a point. Dibyendu Bhattacharya is dependable. The same goes for Pavan Malhotra (Bindal) and Virendra Saxena (Tapan Ghosh). Rajesh Sharma (Govardhan Roy) is over the top. From the miners, Ravi Kishan (Bhola) and Jameel Khan (Pasu) leave a mark followed by Sudhir Pandey (Behra), Varun Badola (Shaligram), Mukesh Bhatt (Murli), Bachan Pachehra (Noor; dog-lover) and Omkar Das Manikpuri (Bishu). Shishir Sharma (O P Dayal) is fair. Rajit Kapur and Ananth Narayan Mahadevan are hardly there.Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue | Official Trailer | Akshay KumarThe songs are disappointing. 'Jalsa 2.0' is well-shot while 'Jeetenge' and 'Keemti' fail to register. Sandeep Shirodkar's background score has a commercial vibe.Aseem Mishra's cinematography is appropriate. Sheetal Iqbal Sharma's costumes are realistic. Amrish Patange and Dayanidhi Patturajan's production design is detailed and well-researched. VFX is very bad. Parvez Shaikh's action is fair. Aarif Sheikh's editing is just right.On the whole, MISSION RANIGANJ makes an impact due to the subject, clap worthy moments in the second half, nail-biting moments and Akshay Kumar’s performance. At the box office, the negligible buzz can affect its prospects and it will need a strong word of mouth to make the desired impact. 
  Dono Movie Review: DONO is a clean family entertainer and works due to its simplicity. 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Oct 2023 22:00:12 +0200 
 DONO is the story of two strangers falling in love. Dev Saraf (Rajveer Deol) is based in Bengaluru and runs a start-up named Primary Workflow Solutions. The business is not going great. On top of it, Alina (Kanikka Kapur), his best friend since childhood and whom he loves dearly, is getting married. Dev declines to be a part of the festivities. But he changes his mind as he feels that attending her marriage can help him find closure. He flies to Hua Hin, Thailand where the marriage is taking place. There, he bumps into Meghna Doshi (Paloma), a close friend of the groom, Nikhil (Rohan Khurana). Another close friend of Nikhil, Gaurav (Aditya Nanda), is also present. He happens to be the ex-boyfriend of Meghna. Both broke up just a month ago. Dev and Meghna are poles apart. While he’s unable to come to terms that the love of his life is getting married, Meghna seems to have moved on rather well. Yet, both get attracted to each other. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Avnish S Barjatya's story is nothing special. There’s hardly any storyline. Avnish S Barjatya and Manu Sharma's screenplay is engaging and is peppered with sweet and simple moments. However, the writing gets stretched after a point. Avnish S Barjatya and Manu Sharma's dialogues are devoid of any over-the-top one-liners and are very situational.Avnish S Barjatya's direction is uncomplicated. He understands the technicalities like a pro, despite being a debutant director. Also, just like the style of his father Sooraj Barjatya, his content is devoid of any intimacy or violence. It’s a complete, clean family entertainer. The situations in the film are very relatable be it domination by a partner, the quest to find closure, unrequited love, hypocrisy of the society involving womenfolk etc. Also, the troubles and fun associated with a destination wedding, especially when it’s abroad, make for a great watch. Some characters and comical scenes like the cricket match, Dev-Meghna's meeting at the pani puri stall, etc, add to the humour.On the flipside, at 156 minutes, the film is too lengthy. After a point, it becomes tedious to sit through the film. Secondly, the track of Dev and his parents is very unconvincing. It is strange that Dev is meeting his parents after three years at the Thailand wedding. Yet, he’s not shown spending time with them. Some factual errors distract viewers. For instance, Dev coolly says that he has a flight in 2 hours. Yet, he’s seated in his hotel which is more than an hour's drive from the nearest airport!Both Rajveer Deol and Paloma look great on screen and have a fine presence. However, they need to fine-tune their craft. Kanikka Kapur is decent. Aditya Nanda plays his character with panache. Manik Papneja (Gopal aka Gappu) is superb and raises a lot of laughs. Poojan Chhabra (Vilas) also adds to the fun. Rohan Khurana gets no scope. Sanjay Nath (Jagmohan; the groom’s father) is excellent as the man who never smiles. Micky Makhija (Dilip Saraf)’s performance suffers due to the writing. Mohit Chauhan (Ashok Jaisingh) leaves a mark in the beginning but later on, he doesn’t have much to do. Tisca Chopra (Anjali Malhotra) hams. Varun Buddhadev (young Dev) and Muskan Kalyani (young Alina) are lovely.Dono: Official Trailer | Rajveer Deol, Paloma Thakeria, Avnish S. BarjatyaShankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music doesn’t have a shelf life. The title song is the most memorable one. 'Khamma Ghani' is based on an interesting idea. This is followed by 'Mann Mauji', Khatt Mitthiyaan', 'Agg Lagdi', 'Lehenga Padd Gaya Mehenga' and 'Raangla'. George Joseph's background score has a cinematic, commercial feel.Chirantan Das' cinematography is appropriate. The locales of Thailand are well-shot. Sujeet Sawant and Sriram Iyengar's production design is top-class. Terrence Lobo's costumes are very glamorous, especially the ones worn by the leading actors. Shweta Venkat Mathew's editing is weak. The film could have been shorter by at least 15 minutes.On the whole, DONO is a clean family entertainer and works due to its simplicity, relatable goings-on and some funny and emotional moments. At the box office, it’ll need a strong word of mouth to attract its target audience. 
  Khufiya Movie Review: On the whole, KHUFIYA is a well-made gripping saga. 
 
 
 Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:24:36 +0200 
 KHUFIYA is the story of a mole in India’s intelligence agency. The year is 2004. Krishna Mehra (Tabu) works for the Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) and is based in Dhaka. She comes across Heena Rehman (Azmeri Haque), who offers to spy for India in exchange for money, which she desperately needs for her father’s illness. Krishna agrees and while working with her, both fall in love. Unknown to Krishna, Heena is sent on a mission to eliminate Brigadier Mirza (Shataf Figar). Before she can do so, Mirza is informed of the plan. He eliminates Heena. A few months later, Krishna's boss Jeev (Ashish Vidyarthi) learns that Ravi Mohan (Ali Fazal), an employee at RAW, told Bangladesh about Heena's involvement, leading to her death. His office is bugged and that's when the RAW finds out the truth about Ravi. But to gather more evidence, his house too is riddled with surveillance cameras. Krishna, too, is made a part of this operation which she names 'Brutus'. While spying on them, Krishna learns about Ravi's bond with his wife Charu (Wamiqa Gabbi), son Kunal (Swastik Tiwari) and Ravi's mother Lalita (Navnindra Behl). At the same time, Krishna also gets the shock of her life when she finds out who Ravi is actually working for. What happens next forms the rest of the film.KHUFIYA is based on the book 'Escape To Nowhere' by Amar Bhushan. The story is one of the strengths of the film as it's very arresting. Rohan Narula and Vishal Bhardwaj's screenplay does justice to the superb plot in hand. The focus is chiefly on the characters and the madness that ensues in their lives. Vishal Bhardwaj's dialogues are sharp and well-worded.Vishal Bhardwaj's direction is exemplary and this is one of his best works. We have seen films in this zone like PARMANU (2018), RAAZI (2018), BABY (2015) or even in Hollywood like MUNICH [2005] to name a few. Thanks to his execution, one doesn't think of these films or draw parallels with them. Not a single moment is boring as a lot is happening. A few twists are unexpected and will leave audiences amazed. At the same time, the way the equation between certain characters changes is seen to be believed.On the flipside, a few developments are confusing. It also takes a while to realize that the flashback has commenced or ended. A simple text like 'Dhaka - 6 months ago' would have been helpful. Secondly, the way our agencies are able to hoodwink foreign officials in multiple places is a bit hard to digest. The climax is gripping but could have been more nail-biting.KHUFIYA begins with a very memorable scene and sets the tone. If you feel the film will drop as the makers would take their time to introduce characters, you are mistaken. The makers waste no time in explaining the situation of Ravi. A few scenes that stand out are Krishna and her team bugging Ravi's house, Charu dancing to 'Yeh Jawani Hai Diwani', Krishna's son blasting her mother, and what could be said as the interval point. In the second half, the scene where Ravi argues with his mother is funny. The pre-climax and climax are too good.Speaking of performances, Tabu yet again gets to play a meaty role and she makes good use of it. There's no false note in her act and as always, it’s a pleasure to see her in such challenging parts. Wamiqa Gabbi once again hits the ball out of the park after her acts in JUBILEE and CHARLIE CHOPRA &amp; THE MYSTERY OF THE SOLANG VALLEY. She is fully convincing as the bored housewife who is at heart a filmy bug and a devastated mother who has lost the will to live. Here's hoping she continues her great work as a talent like hers is rare. Azmeri Haque is the surprise of the film. She's sure to become a talking point after the film's release. Ali Fazal gets a bit overshadowed but leaves a mark nevertheless. Navnindra Behl is a bigger surprise of the film. See it to believe it! Shataf Figar and Ashish Vidyarthi are decent. Atul Kulkarni (Shashank) is fine in a special appearance. Swastik Tiwari, Lalit Parimoo (Home Minister Naren Mishra), Rahul Vohra (Wasan), Disney James (Kutty), Jan Graveson (Rachel Mcclane), Meet Vohra (Vikram; Krishna's son), Virendra Vashisht (Sardar old man in RAW), Shashi Bhushan (Michael; who is spying from milk centre), Geeta (Priyanka Setia; Michael's associate), Alexx O Nell (Dr David Langley) and Monica Rae (Langley's wife) are fine in small roles. Rahul Ram (Yaar Jogiya) is superb.Vishal Bhardwaj's music doesn't have a shelf life but is well woven into the narrative. 'Mat Aana' is the best of the lot followed by 'Bujhee Bujhee' and 'Mann Na Rangaave'. 'Tanhaai Hai' and 'Naa Hosh Chaley' are okay. Vishal Bhardwaj's background score adds to the thrill and mystery.Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi's cinematography is commendable. The locales of Alberta are well captured. T P Abid's production design is detailed. Karishma Sharma's costumes are realistic. The same applies to Harpal Singh's stunts. A Sreekar Prasad's editing is razor sharp.On the whole, KHUFIYA is a well-made gripping saga. It works big time due to the intriguing plot, tight screenplay, twists and turns and exemplary performances by Tabu and Wamiqa Gabbi. 
  Fukrey 3 Movie Review: FUKREY 3 is a well-packaged entertainer and a fun ride 
 
 
 Tue, 26 Sep 2023 21:35:40 +0200 
 FUKREY 3 is the story of good-for-nothing guys entering politics. After the events of the second part, Hunny (Pulkit Samrat), Choocha (Varun Sharma), Lali (Manjot Singh), and Pandit (Pankaj Tripathi) continue to run the store provided to them by the Delhi government. However, the business is down. Meanwhile, Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadha), has stood for elections on a ticket of Janhit Samaj Party. She asks Hunny, Choocha, Lali, and Pandit to help her and use Choocha’s ‘Deja Chu’ if needed. However, during the campaign, Choocha, unintentionally, steals the show and becomes the favourite of the aam junta. The foursome decide that Choocha should also fight the elections and defeat Bholi, who they believe, would not do anything worthwhile for the residents once she wins. However, campaigning requires money which the Fukrey gang doesn’t have. This is when they get an opportunity from South Africa. Shunda Singh Ahluwalia (Manu Rishi Chadha) owns a mine and is struggling to find diamonds. Choocha is invited there to help them locate diamonds through the use of ‘Deja Chu’. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vipul Vig’s story is crazy but very entertaining. Vipul Vig’s screenplay (additional screenplay by Mrighdeep Singh Lamba) is superb. The script is peppered with very funny and outrageous moments that are sure to bring the house down and catch viewers by surprise, especially the hydrocarbon idea. There are issues in the script, but those are minor ones thankfully. Vipul Vig’s dialogues (additional dialogues by Mrighdeep Singh Lamba) are hilarious and add significantly to the fun quotient. The use of English dialogues for Pandit are also smartly incorporated to induce laughter.Mrighdeep Singh Lamba’s direction is terrific. One needs a lot of conviction to pull off a script that is as absurd as this one and ensure that the audience doesn’t look for logic. Instead, thanks to his direction, the audience would be too busy laughing instead of asking questions. A few scenes will amaze viewers. For instance, to show the fan ‘reacting’ when Bholi mentions her full name is nothing short of a masterstroke. The other scenes that work are the echo sequence, Lali busy preparing tea while his friends are busy in a crucial discussion, Choocha campaigning in a tank, the African young girl crying her guts out etc.Sadly, FUKREY 3 is not without its share of blemishes. The film dips in the South Africa episode. The pre-climax is too serious and looks out of place in a laugh-a-minute-riot like this film. The ending is simplistic. The track of Shunda should have had more meat in the second half, especially because he has a clear reason to be angry with the Fukrey gang. Certain important characters of the series are missing in the film and the makers don’t provide explanation why is that so. Lastly, the toilet humour gets too much after a point.FUKREY 3 belongs to Varun Sharma. Choocha has a huge fan base and he rocked the show in the first 2 parts. In the third installment, Varun once again ensures that he fulfills people’s expectations. Pulkit Samrat, too, delivers an entertaining performance. His six-pack abs are sure to get a response in cinemas. Pankaj Tripathi is adorable. He kills it with his performance and the makers, too, give him some witty and funny lines to mouth. Richa Chadha is powerful yet again. In a few scenes, she’s also vulnerable and that gives an interesting arc to her character. Manjot Singh gets dominated a bit but he gets his share of crazy sequences to shine. Manu Rishi Chadha is okay and doesn’t get much to do after a point. The actor playing Dhingra is too good as the villain. The actress playing Mumbasa is cute and performs ably.All the songs are in the background and are well woven into the narrative. The title song and ‘Rabba’ are the best of the lot. The recap song is played in the opening credits is witty and is helpful as it provides a recap of the first two parts. Abhishek Nailwal’s background score enhances the impact. The theme of the antagonist is memorable.Amalendu Chaudhary’s cinematography is terrific and very novel. It’s rare to see such supreme camerawork in mid-sized comic films. Some shots that stand out are Choocha enjoying the slide at the water park, the tricolor visible on Shunda’s sunglasses, the underwater shot of the crocodile etc. Theia Tekchandaney’s costumes are a little flashy and it is apt for the characters in the film. Manohar Verma’s action is realistic. Sandeep Meher’s production design is straight out of life. Manan Ashwin Mehta’s editing is slick.On the whole, FUKREY 3 is a well-packaged entertainer that works due to the crazy and hilarious script, strong brand value, and the extreme popularity of the characters, especially Choocha. At the box office, the film will reap the benefit of the long-extended weekend which will keep the producers and the distributors happy. 
  The Great Indian Family Movie Review: THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY rests on a promising storyline but fails to impress 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:03:36 +0200 
 THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY is the story of a devotional singer. Ved Vyas Tripathi (Vicky Kaushal) lives in Balrampur with his deeply religious family comprising Pandit Siya Ram Tripathi (Kumud Mishra), bua Sushila Kumari (Alka Amin), chacha Balak Ram (Manoj Pahwa), chachi Hema (Sadiya Siddiqui) and twin sister Gunja (Srishti Dixit). Ved is also known as Bhajan Kumar since he's a reputed devotional singer in the town. Ved's best friends are Bhaata (Bhuvan Arora) and Sarveshwar (Ashutosh Ujjwal). Sarveshwar falls for Jasmeet (Manushi Chhillar) and the former asks Bhaata and Ved for help to impress her. While doing so, Ved falls for Jasmeet. This creates a rift between Ved and Sarveshwar. If that is not enough, Ved gets another shocker. A stranger arrives at their house and leaves a letter informing them that Ved was born a Muslim. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Vijay Krishna Acharya's story is very promising and has all the trappings of a commercial entertainer. But Vijay Krishna Acharya's screenplay is not upto the mark. The writer-director tries his best to add dramatic moments but these scenes fail to pack a punch. Vijay Krishna Acharya's dialogues are sharp in places.Vijay Krishna Acharya's direction gets affected due to an underwhelming script. To give credit where it's due, he has handled certain moments with panache like Ved’s childhood track, Ved meeting Abdul and his family for the first time, the climax monologue etc. The idea of the family undertaking a vote before a crucial decision and also the snakes-and-ladder aspect is creative. The message of communal harmony also comes across well.However, a film like this should have ideally had more humour and more hard-hitting scenes. THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY has neither. The goings-on that occur after Ved’s Muslim identity is revealed doesn’t create the desired impact. The romantic track is also weak.The Great Indian Family Trailer | Vicky Kaushal, Manushi Chhillar | Vijay Krishna AcharyaSpeaking of performances, Vicky Kaushal, as always, puts up a very sincere act. The scene in the second half where he struggles to speak while crying is damn good and shows his acting brilliance. Manushi Chhillar has an arresting screen presence. But she is wasted. In fact, she is hardly there in the film after the first 45 minutes. Kumud Mishra leaves a mark. He is also convincing as an influential town resident. Manoj Pahwa, too, performs well. Alka Amin, Sadiya Siddiqui and Srishti Dixit lend able support. Bhuvan Arora and Ashutosh Ujjwal are okay. Yashpal Sharma (Pandit Jagannath Mishra) and Aasif Khan (Tulsidas Mishra) are decent as the antagonists. Hittesh Arrora (Abdul) and Devang Tanna (Pintu) are likeable. Saloni Khanna (Aishwarya) and Paritosh Sand (Jai Prakash Malpani) don't have much to do.Pritam's music won’t have a long shelf life. All three songs - 'Kanhaiya Twitter Pe Aaja', 'Sahibaa' and 'Ki Farak Painda Hai' - are beautifully shot and choreographed but are not catchy enough. Kingshuk Chakravarty's background score is appropriate.Ayananka Bose's cinematography is neat. Sumit Basu, Snigdha Basu and Rajnish Hedao's production design is very authentic and a layman won’t be able to realize that the whole film has been shot on a set and not in real-life locations. Sheetal Sharma's costumes are straight out of life. YFX's VFX is top-class. Charu Shree Roy's editing is fine.On the whole, THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILY rests on a promising storyline but fails to impress since the script and goings-on don’t pack a punch. At the box office, the film will struggle due to a lack of awareness. 
  Expend4bles (English) Movie Review: EXPEND4BLES is a poor show due to the weak storyline 
 
 
 Fri, 22 Sep 2023 12:31:22 +0200 
 EXPEND4BLES is the story of a group of mercenaries avenging their friend’s death. The Expendables get a new mission from Marsh (Andy Garcia) of CIA. They are told to head to Libya and prevent a mercenary, Rahmat (Iko Uwais), from stealing a nuclear detonator, which the latter plans to give to the mysterious Ocelot. While the Expendables try to land at an airstrip in Libya, they are attacked by Rahmat's army. Almost all of them get down from the plane and attack Rahmat's men. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), however, keeps flying the aeroplane and indulges in aerial aggression. Sadly, the plane is shot down. Barney is believed to be dead. The Expendables is devastated. On top of it, Marsh asks them to go after Ocelot and Rahmat, but without Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) since he jeopardized the mission while trying to save Barney. But Christmas is not ready to lie down while his friend died a brutal death. He manages to track and follow his group members. What happens next forms the rest of the film.Spenser Cohen, Kurt Wimmer and Tad Daggerhart's story is just okay. Kurt Wimmer, Tad Daggerhart and Max Adams' screenplay is not up to the mark. We have seen far more exciting moments in the previous films of the franchise. The dialogues are just fine.Scott Waugh's direction is decent. To give credit where it's due, he has handled the grandeur and action like a pro. Some scenes are too good like Barney and Christmas’s fight in the bar in the beginning, Christmas and Gina’s (Megan Fox) playful face-off before hitting the bed, The Expendables being ambushed on the ship etc. The finale is also arresting.On the flipside, though the team tries its best, the action moments fail to compel viewers to break into applause or whistles. The villain is weak. The intention of a positive character to turn antagonist is not convincing enough. The bromance is also an important aspect of THE EXPENDABLES franchise and even that is lacking in adequate doses. Lastly, the absence of subtitles makes it difficult to decipher certain dialogues, especially those of Jason Statham.Speaking of performances, Sylvester Stallone is quite good but his screen time is limited. He’s like the face of the franchise. Hence, fans will be disappointed to see that he is in an extended guest appearance. Jason Statham gets the maximum screen time and he’s superb as always. Megan Fox is sizzling and puts up a very good act. 50 Cent (Easy Day), Dolph Lundgren (Gunner), Randy Couture (Toll Road), Jacob Scipio (Galan) and Levy Tran (Lash) don’t get much scope. Iko Uwais has an arresting screen presence but again, gets side-lined after a point. Andy Garcia is okay. Tony Jaa (Decha) leaves a huge mark.Guillaume Roussel's music is fine and in sync with the film's genre and theme. Tim Maurice-Jones' cinematography is neat. The production design is apt. Neil McClean's costumes are stylish and make the characters look cool. VFX is shockingly tacky in a few scenes. The action is a bit violent, as expected, and works. Michael J Duthie's editing is slick.On the whole, EXPEND4BLES is a poor show due to the weak storyline, unexciting action and limited screen time of Sylvester Stallone.

 EXCLUSIVE: Vipin Sharma to turn author with his book ‘One Way Ticket’; says, “It’s not an autobiography” 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 20:03:20 +0200 
 Actor Vipin Sharma, who is still remembered for his act in Taaze Zameen Par, is all set to turn an author. Titled ‘One Way Ticket’, his book will be about his life but not an autobiography. Sharing the news exclusively with Bollywood Hungama, Sharma said, “I wanted to write a book that actually inspires people. If I can contribute something from my journey to someone, that will be the biggest achievement. I really hope that it encourages someone to fulfil their dream.”Sharing more details, the actor added, “I don’t want to talk about my life as much as I want to talk about the creative process, the joy of wanting to do things you really love. It’s more of that. So, it’s not an autobiography in that sense. It’s about things I have learnt over the years; people who have influenced me and I have learnt from. The book can motivate anyone and everyone from any walk of life and not just actors. It will have my experiences of working with filmmakers, actors and colleagues from the fraternity. It will also include my entire process of not just acting but also my voyage to where I have reached today.”Sharing an example of the same, Sharma said, “How I quit smoking is something very important in my life. It’s been over 15 years now. So, I want to share those things that made a difference in my life, so that it can make a difference in someone else’s life. It’s not just about health. I tell people that if you quit smoking, there will be miracle in your life.”When asked about the release, he said, “We are thinking of releasing it in December this year. I feel it should come when we are ready. But most probably by the end of this year.” The actor said that he has signed up with the literary consultants The Sunflower Seeds to release the book.Apart from Taare Zameen Par, Vipin Sharma is also known for films like Paan Singh Tomar, Gangs Of Wasseypur, Special 26, Raanjhanaa, Kick, Hotel Mumbai, etc, and shows like Paatal Lok, The Family Man and Guns And Gulaabs.Along with the likes of Irrfan Khan and Ali Fazal, he is also one of the few Bollywood actors of this era to dabble in international cinema. His film Dear Jassi was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He is a part of the keenly-awaited Hollywood film Monkey Man, which stars Dev Patel in the lead. Sharma will soon be leaving for South By South West Film Festival in Austin for its premiere. He will also be attending the film’s screenings in Los Angeles and London later.Speaking about Monkey Man, Sharma said, “This is a very important film. It was shot during the pandemic. It was a new lease of life because I hadn’t gone out for seven months before this shoot. It was a blessing to suddenly just go to an island and be there for five and a half months during a very difficult time. It became very special. And working with Dev Patel was amazing.”Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Author Harinder Sikka starts Third Innings Productions with Rahul Nanda

 EXCLUSIVE: Author Harinder Sikka starts Third Innings Productions with Rahul Nanda 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 14:57:50 +0200 
 Author Harinder Sikka, whose book Calling Sehmat was converted into the film Raazi, has started a production house along with his partner Rahul Nanda.Sharing the news exclusively with Bollywood Hungama, Sikka said, “I have launched a company by the name Third Innings Productions LLP. My partner is Mr Rahul Nanda, who is arguably the biggest publicist in Mumbai. He is the son of the legendary Gulshan Nanda, who wrote films like Kati Patang, Khilona, etc. Rahul Nanda made posters for my first film Nanak Shah Fakir, which won three National Awards, including the award for Best Film on National Integration. I discuss every small and big thing with Rahul Nanda. He is a mentor for me as far as Bollywood is concerned.”Sharing his aim as a producer, Sikka added, “I wanted to launch such a platform for writers (so) that they get their due. Not only during starting stage but they also should get shareholding in the film. This is rare and perhaps not acceptable by most of the people, but we will do that. Content provider is the king.”Harinder Sikka has bought the rights of author Tarun Mehrishi’s debut novel ‘The Portrait Of A Secret’ to turn it into a film. It tells the real story of an Indian intelligence officer who is faced with the task of averting a nuclear attack on India. As per the name of the book, a portrait plays an important role in the story. “It is a real-life story,” said Sikka. “I know the protagonist personally who did it. He put his mind, career and life at stake at times to bring back the portrait. That portrait is priceless. The masses are loving it. The book is selling as hot cakes in schools and colleges.”When asked whether he has thought of a director to helm the project, he said, “First and foremost is the screenplay. That takes a very long time. Once that is done, we will discuss with some top names.”During the course of the chat, Sikka said that he has a close association with filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani and he wishes to collaborate with him some day. “Raju Hirani is someone I admire and trust blindly. He is a very dear friend of mine. I have spoken on length on various issues with him. I am sure we will do some work together in times to come. When I do not know. But the fact is that I trust him. That’s a huge statement by me for anybody. I get insights on what to do and what not to do (from him),” he said.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: “Made a blunder by handing Calling Sehmat to Meghna Gulzar to make Raazi,” says Harinder Sikka as Maddock Films buys rights of his next book Vichhoda

 Yami Gautam's latest film Article 370 has witnessed triumph both critically and commercially. The film has not just been lauded but is also being looked at as an instrument for people to witness the story of reformed Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 from the valley.

 Following the super success of Baipan Bhari Deva, Kedar Shinde, Jio Studios announce Aaipan Bhari Deva 
 
 
 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 12:01:40 +0200 
 Filmmaker Kedar Shinde’s Marathi movie Baipan Bhari Deva not only became a success at the box office but also became one of the biggest blockbusters in the language. Produced by Jio Studios and Shinde, the movie starred an ensemble cast of female actors like Rohini Hattangadi, Vandana Gupte, Deepa Parab, Suchitra Bandekar, Sukanya Kulkarni Mone and Shilpa Navalkar. Now, the makers have announced a sequel to the film titled Aaipan Bhari Deva.The announcement was made today by Jio Studios and Shinde. The makers haven’t revealed whether the film will take forward the same story and will have the same cast.Speaking about the film, Shinde said, “Baipan Bhari Deva has taught me valuable lessons. I made the film for my mother, my wife, my daughter, my aunt and my grandfather. With each film, we take away learnings, but its overwhelming response inspired me to understand better and delve deeper into a woman’s mind. With success comes responsibility, and while planning my next film, I thought being a mother has so many facets and a mother’s emotions are like a bottomless sea, why not make a film dedicated to all mothers? Aaipan Bhari Deva is not just for all women…but for every human being… Because everyone has a mother. I’m looking forward to partnering once again with Jio Studios who backed me on my vision for Baipan Bhari Deva and are committed to compelling storytelling. With Aaipan Bhari Deva, we hope to once again deliver a film that will cut across all audiences and leave an enduring impact.”Interestingly, in an exclusive chat with Bollywood Hungama in last July, Shinde had said that he will make a sequel to Baipan Bhari Deva only if he finds a good script. He had said, “There is a lot of responsibility. It’s not easy. The film has become a tremendous brand, so I will get money (if I make a sequel). But I need to think whether I should concentrate on making money or be concerned about losing the respect I have in audience’s hearts. I would never want that respect to go. The day I feel that this is the perfect script for Baipan 2 only then I will make it. But right now there is no such plan.”Aaipan Bhari Deva is produced by Kedar Shinde Productions, Jyoti Deshpande and Bela Shinde, co-produced by Ajit Bhure and written by Vaishali Naik and Omkar Mangesh Dutt.Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Baipan Bhari Deva had to wait 3 years for release: “It was a tough period, I didn’t know what was Swami Samarth’s wish,” says Kedar Shinde

 Fri, 08 Mar 2024 09:46:01 +0200 
 The first four episodes of the web series Showtime dropped today on Disney+ Hotstar. The Karan Johar-produced show has caught attention since it attempts to show the dark secrets of the Bollywood film industry.

In fact, it could be the highest ever for a Hindi web series.Some of the prominent actors who have a special appearance in Showtime are Janhvi Kapoor, Mrunal Thakur, Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi. Then, veteran actor Dharmendra makes his web debut-of-sorts with a special appearance in this show. And that’s not all. Reputed filmmakers like Hansal Mehta, Gurmmeet Singh of Mirzapur fame, Dangal (2016) and Chhichhore (2019) director Nitesh Tiwari and Monica O My Darling (2022) director Vasan Bala also appear in crucial scenes.

For a funeral scene, footage of Neetu Kapoor, Rakesh Roshan, Jeetendra and Prem Chopra from an actual final journey of a real-life celebrity has been neatly woven into the narrative.

It was put on the backburner due to pandemic-related factors.Showtime stars Emraan Hashmi, Mahima Makwana, Rajeev Khandelwal, Mouni Roy and Shriya Saran in lead roles with Naseeruddin Shah in a supporting role. It is the story of the son of a famous producer, who tries to run the family-owned studio on his own terms, causing friction between the two.

During the lockdown, we had our sets standing in Madh (an area in Mumbai) for around three and a half years. When we would get a window to shoot, we had all the players and technicians coming from all over the world. They would land here, shoot a match for maybe eight-ten days and there would be a lockdown again. This happened to us thrice.”Maidaan makers also suffered losses due to the Mumbai Cyclone in 2019 which led to the destruction of their sets. Boney Kapoor is grateful that the team and crew members did not lose patience at all and were eager to complete the film. “In all this, it was not only about hard work, but also about having patience. As a team we didn’t lose patience and I am glad we didn’t,” he said.Talking about the delay, director Amit Ravindernath Sharma said, “It was frustrating. You prepare and shooting does not happen, it was natural to be frustrated. When the shooting happened, we used to enjoy it and that’s how we completed the whole thing.”Based on a true story, Maidaan is directed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma of Badhaai Ho fame, and also features Priyamani, Gajraj Rao, and the well-known Bengali actor Rudranil Ghosh.Produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Arunava Joy Sengupta and Akash Chawla, the screenplay and dialogues are written by Saiwyn Quadras and Ritesh Shah respectively, music is by AR Rahman and lyrics by Manoj Muntashir Shukla.

The first part is expected to end with the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana. The makers don’t want to rush the story and want to narrate the epic in an entertaining, sensitive and cinematic manner.”The source, however, is not aware if Sunny Deol as Lord Hanuman will have a major role or if will he appear in a cameo in Part 1. He, however, added, “The second part is expected to depict Lord Ram and Lakshman meeting Lord Hanuman and the Vaanar Sena, the obstacles they face and finally the construction of Ram Setu.

With a long-term vision to solidify the Indian hip-hop brand imprint overseas, he will be embarking on an expansive global summer tour from May to August of this year.Currently, a 6-date arena run with stops across Toronto (May 31st), Vancouver (June 1st), San Francisco (June 7th), Houston (June 8th), Dallas (June 9th) and New Jersey (June 15th) have been announced. Tickets will go live for general sales on Ticketmaster and Sulekha on 1st March 2024. Additional dates for cities such as Singapore, Washington DC, Los Angeles and the Netherlands will be announced for the next few weeks.Touring in support of his much-awaited third studio album Ek Tha Raja, the upcoming global showcase was previously premiered in India with a sold-out 10-city trek and will couple stellar visual storytelling with state-of-the-art production. The tour with its fresh format will entail a 3-hour show and embrace an eclectic setlist of over 30 songs. Fans can expect to be regaled with some of his all-time radio hits such as ‘Jugnu’, ‘Paani Paani’, ‘Garmi’, ‘DJ Waale Babu’, ‘Lets Nacho’, ‘Kala Chashma’, ‘Kar Gayi Chull’, ‘Genda Phool’, ‘Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai’ and ‘Paagal’, amongst others.Speaking to Bollywood Hungama about his anticipated world tour, Badshah says, "Grateful and privileged. The Paagal Tour is an homage to my community, symbolizing the power to achieve dreams, shatter stereotypes, and transcend boundaries. Live performances are the highlight of my career. India's cultural richness is something to be proud of, and I salute every Indian contributing to a positive global image. We've moved beyond mere labels, proving our worth. The divide between East and West in entertainment and music is diminishing, fostering more cross-cultural exchange and equal opportunities on both sides."While Badshah has delivered singular global performances over the past few years—such as his sold-out shows across London, Leeds, Dubai and Abu Dhabi - The Paagal Tour 2024 will mark the rapper’s first-ever multi-city global arena trek of a considerable scale.The nomenclature of the tour, suggestive of a celebration of the 38-year-old’s artistry and legacy over the last decade, aptly sums up Badshah’s sentiments of the unprecedented run as he prepares to hit the road and set a brand new milestone for the Indian hip hop industry.Recently rapper-entrepreneur-philanthropist grabbed headlines for becoming the first-ever Indian hip-hop artist to headline the mainstage of UNTOLD which is ranked as the world’s #6 music festival and Europe’s #3 music festival by DJ Mag.Badshah states, “Grateful and blessed. This year has kickstarted on an extremely electrifying note and I’m appreciative that I’m getting to do everything that I’m truly passionate about. The Paagal Tour is about the ability to conquer your dreams, break stereotypes and transcend boundaries- inspire to be inspired. See you in the arenas soon for one of my most experimental and never-before-seen live show experiences to date! Love and peace!”Originally due in 2023, his upcoming album Ek Tha Raja was ultimately pushed back to 2024. In a message to his fans announcing the postponement, Badshah assured his audiences that his latest album would be worth the longer-than-expected wait. Billed as the biggest gift the artist has ever presented to his global fan community, the full album will be released sometime in mid-March 2024 and will feature a slew of top-ranking collaborators.

 Wed, 06 Mar 2024 11:57:51 +0200 
 The sudden demise of popular Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput left the nation in shock. The actor, reportedly, was found hanging on the ceiling fan of his bedroom at his Mumbai apartment about three and half years ago. Since then, the case has been under investigation. His sister Shweta Singh Kirti, who was quite close to the actor, has now yet again requested the CBI to investigate and give them proper answers about his demise.In an interview with Ranveer Allahabadia, Shweta Singh Kirti revealed about how several things about her brother’s demise doesn’t make sense and has requested the CBI to investigate further to get to the truth.  “I am not an investigator, I cannot investigate the case. I was not allowed to enter Bhai’s flat. I haven’t seen his flat where it all happened. I cannot investigate. I want CBI to tell us what happened. Whatever happened, give us proof and let us know,” she told during the interview.She also explained about how certain things were not adding up as she shared, “We can really come together and plead to CBI to tell us what exactly happened. There was not enough space the between bed and the fan to hang himself. When you leave an apartment, you have to return the keys. The person who deals with that apartment told us that the keys of his room were missing. Why? Where did it go? They had given the keys. Sushant never used to lock his room’s door. That day, his door was locked. All nearby CCTVs were also not working that day. There are a lot of things which do not make sense.”However, she asserted that she continues to hold on to faith and trusts the authorities to get to the bottom of this. “They are the best investigators in the country. They will be able to figure out something. I am sure they will find out something. If it was a suicide, tell us about it, tell us how did it happen,”Also Read: Bombay High Court quashes LOCs issued against Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, and father in Sushant Singh Rajput case

And as one of the most prized IPs, we take a lot of pride in it. So there's a lot of stuff that's going to come on the spy universe. We're going to see more and more films getting made under it. But of course, not going to share everything here. But we will talk about it at a more opportune time. But for now, I can just say that Alia Bhatt is headlining a spy universe film.”
⁩
Alia Bhatt is set to team up with young and rising Bollywood star Sharvari Wagh in the yet-to-be-titled film. They will play super-agents in the action entertainer! The YRF Spy Universe kicked off with Salman Khan’s Ek Tha Tiger (2012) then followed by Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), and War (2019), starring Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff. It was taken forward with Pathaan, starring Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and John Abraham and then Tiger 3 with Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif.

It trended at Number three on Netflix! The Romantics, a docu-series on YRF and its impact on Pop culture for 50 years, also became a global success story.Akshaye says, “The Railway Men trended in over 36 countries, but you feel the success of content when you know people who don't speak your language, are watching the content and appreciating it. For me, that is a huge definition of success. We are a company that is not afraid to fail. We want to be able to do disruptive content.He adds, “India loves the movies. It's a big part of our culture, it's a big part of our team. And I think The Romantics was a journey that every viewer went on. So everybody has a YRF story in their life. My parents had a YRF story from Yash Ji's times. I had a YRF story from Adi's times. So like me, there are other people who all have a YRF story. There is a song that played at your wedding, which was from a YRF movie. There was a time in life when you went watch a movie and that was a YRF movie and you went with that certain someone which you might be with or might not be with, but you still have fond memories of.”Akshaye further says, “I think, because of that connect, and connect with this company, and the studio has had it, it's a cultural connect with audiences. And I think that's what excited people and drew people to watch the Romantics that would make them love it more. The sheer nostalgia here, as to the youth connected to them, because again, there was a story about their family, or a movie that they have watched and loved. Not to forget, it also had Aditya Chopra making his debut on screen and that gave us incredible amount of eyeballs!”Also Read: BREAKING: Yash Raj Films delays Tiger vs Pathaan; Shah Rukh Khan-Salman Khan starrer will go on floors only in 2025 and release in 2026

 Renowned comedian Sunil Pal has recently voiced his disapproval of the promotional material for Kapil Sharma's forthcoming show, The Great Indian Kapil Show, slated to stream on Netflix. Taking to Instagram, Pal expressed concerns over the alleged use of inappropriate language in the promotional videos.In a video shared on his Instagram handle, Pal commended Kapil Sharma as a comedic icon beloved by millions for his family-friendly entertainment. However, he raised objections to what he perceived as the use of vulgar language in the promotional content for the upcoming show on the OTT platform.Pal stated, "After watching the promo videos of the upcoming show on OTT, I am disappointed. Kapil Sharma is our comedy superstar. He is the king of comedy and people love him as a family entertainer. But his new show is coming now on OTT, and in its promo, I see filth, the use of dirty words. I feel like my language will be defeated here, and I cannot watch it. Kapil, I am your biggest fan, but you have to stop this... not just for me but for millions of your fans."Expressing his reservations about other team members, including Krushna Abhishek and Kiku Sharda, Pal appealed to Sharma to maintain the wholesome nature of his comedy. He urged Sharma to consider the impact of his content on his vast fan base, emphasizing the importance of steering clear of what he referred to as "filthy" elements.Furthermore, Pal criticized the promotional tactics employed by the OTT platform, likening it to the promotion of a "porn quota." He cautioned against succumbing to the influence of what he termed as "obscene elements," urging Sharma to distance himself from such content creators.&nbsp;

 Shahid Kapoor to replace Salman Khan in Sooraj Barjatya directorial Prem Ki Shaadi? Here’s what we know 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 13:19:22 +0200 
 In a surprising turn of events for fans eagerly awaiting the next Sooraj Barjatya directorial venture with Salman Khan, the family drama, Prem Ki Shaadi, has hit a creative block. Salman Khan, who was set to star in the film, has reportedly decided to amicably step away from the project due to creative disputes with the director. With the fifth venture on the cards after Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Hum Saath Saath Hain, and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, expectations were high for Prem Ki Shaadi. However, it seems like Barjatya is determined to move forward with the film and has reportedly approached Shahid Kapoor to take on the lead role. The actor had worked with the director on Vivah.Touted as an ambitious project set to grace the silver screen on a grand scale, sources close to the production revealed that Shahid Kapoor's name quickly rose to the top of Barjatya's list, following Salman Khan’s exit. According to a report in Peeping Moon, a source revealed, “Barjatya intends to proceed with this project even after Salman Khan turned it down. He is now tweaking the script and has toned down the age of the lead character. When Salman left the movie, he immediately approached Shahid, who also played the role of ‘Prem’ in his 2006 romantic drama, Vivah. Both have met multiple times, and their conversations thus far point to the possibility of their reunion after 18 years. Barjatya is hopeful to get him on board, while Shahid has also shown his interest, but he hasn't given his final nod yet.”Meanwhile, Shahid Kapoor is working with Rosshan Andrrews on Deva along with Pooja Hegde. He is also working with Anees Bazmee on a comedy entertainer.

 SCOOP: Baba Siddiqui does it again; Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover bonded at his Iftaar Party in 2023 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 09:49:54 +0200 
 In December 2023, Netflix released a quirky video announcing a new show featuring Kapil Sharma, Sunil Grover, Archana Puran Singh and others. The video became a talking point not just for its fun quotient but also because it meant Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover reuniting after a hiatus. Both used to work together on the much-loved comic TV series ‘The Kapil Sharma Show’. In March 2017, they fought on a flight. Kapil was allegedly drunk when he hit Sunil, which led to the latter quitting the show. As a result, their reunion is significant. And Bollywood Hungama has learned that Baba Siddiqui, the politician who ended Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan’s fight, was in a way also responsible for Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover’s joint comeback.A source told Bollywood Hungama, “In 2013, history was made at Baba Siddiqui’s Iftaar party. Shah Rukh and Salman were not on talking terms for nearly five years. But on that fateful day, they came together and hugged, leading to jubilation in the industry and among fans. Ten years later, history repeated at his 2023 Iftaar party where Kapil Sharma and Sunil Grover met and bonded really well. 6 months later, the announcement of their Netflix show dropped.”Interestingly, the Netflix video also hints at their mid-air fracas. Kapil Sharma tells viewers that “(Sunil and I) are going to be in more than 190 countries (through our new show).” At this, Sunil Grover, “Except for Australia,” since the flight was returning to Mumbai from Down Under when the fight occurred. Sunil even jokes, “We won’t go by air. We’ll go by road!” A similar joke is cracked by Sunil in the recently released announcement video, ‘The Great Indian Kapil Show’ of the same show.Of late, Sunil Grover has been seen in multiple projects like Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Goodbye (2022), Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan (2023) and web series like United Kacche and Sunflower. Sunflower's second season, featuring Adah Sharma, was also released recently. Kapil Sharma, meanwhile, continues with his hit TV show. Last year, he was seen in a de-glam role in Nandita Das' Zwigato (2023). He has a cameo in Crew, starring Kareena Kapoor Khan, Tabu and Kriti Sanon.Despite the 2017 fight, Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma spoke highly of each other in interviews. In an interview in 2021, Sunil Grover stated, “As far as collaborating with Kapil is concerned, why not? If I am offered a great concept, I will take it up.” He posted a sweet note when Kapil Sharma’s daughter was born.Kapil Sharma, meanwhile, said in a 2020 interview “Maine Sunil paaji se bahut cheezein seekhe hai, aur future mein, if a good project comes by, unke saath kaam karne mein bada mazaa aayega.” He also expressed concern after Sunil Grover had to undergo heart surgery in early 2022. 
 CBFC grants U/A certificate to Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan while the original version Vash was passed with an ‘A’ certificate, that too with 8 cuts 
 
 
 Tue, 05 Mar 2024 09:30:58 +0200 
 The Ajay Devgn-starrer Shaitaan has been in the news ever since the makers launched the chilling trailer of the film on February 22. The advance booking opened on Sunday to a favourable response and it’s expected to fetch a good opening. On March 4, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) granted a U/A certificate to the makers. It has led to jubilation in the trade and exhibition sector as it would mean that not just adults but even family crowds can now throng theatres to see Shaitaan.Shaitaan received 4 modifications from the Examining Committee (EC) of the CBFC. The EC asked the makers to add a voiceover for the disclaimer and another disclaimer stating 'the film does not support/endorse black magic'. They also told the makers to add a static message on liquor consumption. An abusive word was replaced with a scream. The film also got a visual cut - the makers were asked to reduce visuals of blood oozing from the mouth by 25%.Shaitaan movie releases in cinemas on March 8. The length of the film, as mentioned on the censor certificate, is 132 minutes.Shaitaan movie is an official remake of the 2023 Gujarati super-hit film, Vash. Interestingly, the original film was given an adults-only certificate. A Gujarati film industry member said, “Vash was not just passed with an ‘A’ certificate, but it was also given 8 cuts. Shaitaan, on the other hand, gets U/A and also fewer cuts. Nevertheless, Vash was a super-hit but with a U/A certificate, imagine the business it could have done.”Vash suffered dialogue cuts and also the scenes of bloodshed were deleted at multiple places. In all, the CBFC asked the makers to do 8 cuts and modifications.An industry insider, however, noted, “It is possible that Shaitaan is less gory than Vash and hence, it hasn’t faced so many cuts. Only once we see the film can we make a comparison. Until then, it’s too early to conclude that the CBFC was biased towards the Bollywood remake.”Nevertheless, this comes at a time when the Gujarati industry and even Gujarati cinema moviegoers are slamming the CBFC over the treatment meted out to the recently released period film, Kasoombo. Its director Vijaygiri Bava posted a video alleging the CBFC gave unfair cuts to his film. He revealed that scenes of shlokas were asked to be removed while no cut was given to the religious scenes of Alaudin Khilji’s character. The video, in which the director also claimed that he got the certificate a day before and that he was on the verge of crying, went viral on social media.Also Read: Jyotika on returning to Bollywood after 25 years with Shaitaan: “Very strong role-wise, content-wise and as a film, I feel extremely proud of it”

 Richa Chadha, Dulquer Salmaan, Vir Das REACT to Spanish woman's gang-rape in Jharkhand: “Shame on our rotten society” 
 
 
 Mon, 04 Mar 2024 14:41:40 +0200 
 The recent gang rape incident involving a Spanish woman on a bike tour with her husband has sent shockwaves across the nation. On Friday night, the couple fell victim to a heinous crime allegedly perpetrated by seven individuals in Kurmahat village, Dumka district, Jharkhand. Reacting to this horrific incident, Bollywood actress Richa Chadha took to Instagram to express her outrage, denouncing the treatment of foreigners in India and lamenting the state of society."Shameful! Indians are treating foreigners like they treat their own women. Shame on our rotten society," Chadha wrote in her Instagram post. Joining the chorus of condemnation, actor Dulquer Salmaan expressed his distress over the incident, sharing a video made by the victim's husband on his Instagram stories. Salmaan expressed solidarity with the couple."Crushed to hear about this! You both recently visited Kottayam where close friends hosted you for a meal. This should not happen to anyone anywhere," Salmaan wrote, highlighting the gravity of the situation and the urgent need for societal change.Singer Chinmayi Sripada also weighed in on the issue, criticising the lack of empathy and accountability in Indian society. Referring to previous instances of harassment faced by foreign nationals in the country, Sripada shed light on the importance of acknowledging the problem and implementing effective measures to ensure safety for all."It is well known by now how men in India ogle at and harass foreign nationals and women. Aththi Devo Bhava and Beti Bachao are mere slogans," Sripada remarked, underscoring the gap between rhetoric and action in addressing gender-based violence.Comedian-turned-actor Vir Das also expressed his views on the matter and wrote on X, “The 7 men responsible for Jharkhand need to be found and given the strictest punishment the law can provide. A shameful act that we MUST show will not be tolerated.”This is such an uncalled for, unempathetic response to a foreign national who publishes (after adding he still loves the country) his experiences as a tourist.

Brief Title: Leverage Noninvasive Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation to Reduce Suicidal Behaviors in Vulnerable Adolescents
Official Title: Leveraging Noninvasive Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Smartphone Technology to Reduce Suicidal Behaviors and Suicide Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents
Brief Summary: Suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and suicide are increasingly common in adolescence.

Current face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. If effective, these digitally-delivered interventions could reach far more adolescents at far lower cost than current approaches.

Primary Outcomes:
Measure: Change from Baseline in Non-Suicidal Self Injury Behaviors at 30 Days
Description: Teens will be assessed at the baseline lab visit for emotion regulation and self-harm through questions on the Qualtrics survey (measures are Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and the Youth Self Report). They will also complete a face-to-face interview with a trained staff member to assess their level of non-suicidal self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts. In addition, we will collect measures of psychophysiological reactivity (heart rate variability, cardiac pre-ejection period) to emotional challenge.

All participants will complete the same tasks at subsequent visits (post-treatment, on-year follow-up) and it is hoped that teens who have used the tVNS device for the 30-day intervention period will show improved responses. For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Measure: Improved Reports of Social Isolation and Loneliness
Description: Each participating teen will complete questions regarding feelings of loneliness and social isolation on the Qualtrics survey while in the lab at each visit. We are using the 8-item UCLA loneliness scale to measure this in each teen.

Some teens will be assigned to using the peer support phone app where they will be matched with another teen in this study. They will play a cooperative game with each other, and be able to text and share thoughts, feelings, etc. with each other. This app will hopefully improve teen's self-reported feelings of isolation and loneliness.

For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Measure: Improved Results from Participant's Typical Treatment
Description: Teens who are not placed in one of the active intervention groups will still be able to access our phone app which allows them to play a non-cooperative game on their own, and they are able to text with our team members during regular business hours. The added support will hopefully help their current treatment plan to improve their thoughts and behaviors in regard to suicidal ideation and self-harm.

For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Secondary Outcomes:
Measure: Adherence to tVNS and Phone App intervention from Baseline to 30 days.
Description: Using data from the Xen device and the phone app, we will be able to determine the number of occurances the device and app were accessed, as well as for how much time each was actively used. Participants will also report on acceptability, obtrusiveness, and favorability of both the device and the phone app.
Time Frame: 30 Days

Brief Title: Screening Behavior in Adults With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
Official Title: Illness Perceptions and the Health Belief Model: Screening Behavior in Adults With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
Brief Summary: This study will explore the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an inherited condition in which blood vessel defects called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in direct connections between arteries and veins. Patients most commonly have small AVMs called telangiectases on the tongue, face, hands, mouth, and throat and the mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent nosebleeds are a hallmark of the disease. Large AVMs can also occur in various organs, causing sudden and life-threatening complications.

The study will examine how patients think and feel about their condition and what actions they take to screen for internal symptoms of the disease.

Men and women 18 years of age and older who have HHT may be eligible for this study. Participants fill out a 30-minute questionnaire, available in print or online, that includes questions about the participant s

* beliefs about HHT
* actions taken to screen for internal symptoms of HHT
* experience with HHT
* current health status, family history and demographic information
