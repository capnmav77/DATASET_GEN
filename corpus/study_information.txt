Brief Title: Kinesiotape for Edema After Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty
Official Title: Effect of Kinesiotaping on Edema Management, Pain and Function on Patients With Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty

Brief Title: Leverage Noninvasive Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation to Reduce Suicidal Behaviors in Vulnerable Adolescents
Official Title: Leveraging Noninvasive Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Smartphone Technology to Reduce Suicidal Behaviors and Suicide Among Highly Vulnerable Adolescents
Brief Summary: Suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and suicide are increasingly common in adolescence.

Current face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. If effective, these digitally-delivered interventions could reach far more adolescents at far lower cost than current approaches.

Primary Outcomes:
Measure: Change from Baseline in Non-Suicidal Self Injury Behaviors at 30 Days
Description: Teens will be assessed at the baseline lab visit for emotion regulation and self-harm through questions on the Qualtrics survey (measures are Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and the Youth Self Report). They will also complete a face-to-face interview with a trained staff member to assess their level of non-suicidal self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts. In addition, we will collect measures of psychophysiological reactivity (heart rate variability, cardiac pre-ejection period) to emotional challenge.

All participants will complete the same tasks at subsequent visits (post-treatment, on-year follow-up) and it is hoped that teens who have used the tVNS device for the 30-day intervention period will show improved responses. For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Measure: Improved Reports of Social Isolation and Loneliness
Description: Each participating teen will complete questions regarding feelings of loneliness and social isolation on the Qualtrics survey while in the lab at each visit. We are using the 8-item UCLA loneliness scale to measure this in each teen.

Some teens will be assigned to using the peer support phone app where they will be matched with another teen in this study. They will play a cooperative game with each other, and be able to text and share thoughts, feelings, etc. with each other. This app will hopefully improve teen's self-reported feelings of isolation and loneliness.

For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Measure: Improved Results from Participant's Typical Treatment
Description: Teens who are not placed in one of the active intervention groups will still be able to access our phone app which allows them to play a non-cooperative game on their own, and they are able to text with our team members during regular business hours. The added support will hopefully help their current treatment plan to improve their thoughts and behaviors in regard to suicidal ideation and self-harm.

For the rate of change, we will use percentile ranking vis-a-vis national norms.
Time Frame: 30 Days
Secondary Outcomes:
Measure: Adherence to tVNS and Phone App intervention from Baseline to 30 days.
Description: Using data from the Xen device and the phone app, we will be able to determine the number of occurances the device and app were accessed, as well as for how much time each was actively used. Participants will also report on acceptability, obtrusiveness, and favorability of both the device and the phone app.
Time Frame: 30 Days

* Use the allocated study treatment everyday until the end of the study (during 3 months)
* Be examined by the investigator
* Complete several questionnaires
* Return unused study treatment.

Brief Title: Screening Behavior in Adults With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
Official Title: Illness Perceptions and the Health Belief Model: Screening Behavior in Adults With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
Brief Summary: This study will explore the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an inherited condition in which blood vessel defects called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) result in direct connections between arteries and veins. Patients most commonly have small AVMs called telangiectases on the tongue, face, hands, mouth, and throat and the mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent nosebleeds are a hallmark of the disease. Large AVMs can also occur in various organs, causing sudden and life-threatening complications.

The study will examine how patients think and feel about their condition and what actions they take to screen for internal symptoms of the disease.

Men and women 18 years of age and older who have HHT may be eligible for this study. Participants fill out a 30-minute questionnaire, available in print or online, that includes questions about the participant s

* beliefs about HHT
* actions taken to screen for internal symptoms of HHT
* experience with HHT
* current health status, family history and demographic information
